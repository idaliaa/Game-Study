Metamorphosis,NS9z2QHcZdY,"If You're A Man :

They Didn't Notice You Were Crying
They Didn't Notice You Were Sad
They Didn't Notice You Were Tired
They Didn't Notice You Were Alone
They Didn't Notice How Attentive You Were
They Didn't Notice How Sweet You Actually Are...
They Didn't Notice How You Actually Try To Make Others Smile

They Did Notice You Failing Grades 
They Did Notice Your Unattractive 
They Did Notice The Mean Side Of You 
They Did Notice All Your Mistakes 
They Did Notice All You Flaws They Did Notice That You Weren't Good Enough For Them.

But You Stayed Strong 
You Kept Going On 
You Never Gave Up On Hope You Never Let Them Take You Down 
And You Know They Wasn't Good Enough For You 
And That's What Make You Stronger

You Aren't Ugly 
You Aren't Mean 
You Aren't Lazy 
You Aren't A Failure 
You Aren't A Mistake

You Are Beautiful 
You Are Worth It 
You Do Deserve Everything 
You Are Trying 
You Are Smart 
You Do Deserve To Live

Keep It Up Champ You Got This ❣"

Aunque sea manchada la letra de la canción y lo se se que casi todos se les olvido esta joya de phonk ya que como soy de 2025 pues ahora la moda es phonk squid game, blue horizont etc. Pero muchachos parece que somos los únicos acá porque ya todo es como el meme que por cierto no da gracia pero bueno volviendo al tema pues justamente ya para todos esto es basura cosas bien antiguas ya las olvidan a pesar de que dicen nunca dejare de escuchar esto y se ponen a escuchar otros phonk pero cada tiene sus gusto y lo se yo también odio que haya phonk random como el corre pocoyo el phonk pelota y el phonk playa pero bueno se que a nosotros nos pasa"

I'm a pimp, hoes fallin' for this pimpin' rap game

Bankroll, other ho just a victim that I chose
Have you suckin' 'til it's swole, I be bonin' other hoes
Niggas wanna learn the game, but keep talkin' shit
I'll be forced to trash 'em, may the best man win this

Metamorphosis,NS9z2QHcZdY,"Bassy Dynamic Driver earphones are almost always sound worse compared to the Balanced Armature ones. I make my own earphones with Balanced Armature Drivers. I mainly use Knowles RAF-32873, which are one of the bassiest BA drivers out there if configured right. They're full range drivers, nd they're incredibly small. So I make incredibly small and incredibly comfortable earphones with amazing audio quality. You can wear it for 24 hours straight and your ears won't feel even a single itch. Also the audio quality is top notch, you hear instruments in your ever days songs you can never hear with a normal Dynamic Driver earphone. You hear the music as the artist intended. So basically I make the perfect earphones. Or so I thought. Because god damn. Some songs need dumb bass, and this one is the most. Although I can still hear quite a bit of bass with these earphones. When I wear a cheap DD earbud from soundcore(p20i), I feel an incredibly satisfying bass. So I guess there's no such thing as a perfect earphone. You can certainly get the perfect sound with multiple drivers, using both BA and DDs, but you can never make a perfectly comfortable earphone with DDs. That's actually sad to know."

Metamorphosis,NS9z2QHcZdY,"Рецепт пельменей:
Для начинки:Фарш мясной (курица + свинина) – 700 г
Лук репчатый – 1 шт.
Чеснок – 2 зубчика
Зелень укропа – 1 небольшой пучок
Перец чёрный молотый – по вкусу
Соль – по вкусу 
Для теста (стакан - 250 мл):Мука – 3 стакана
Яйцо – 1 шт.
Масло растительное – 3 ст. ложкиСоли – 0,5 ч. ложки
Кипяток – 1 стакан
Яйцо разболтать с солью, добавить растительное масло и 3 стакана муки, перемешать.
Затем влить стакан кипятка и быстро перемешать тесто ложкой.
После этого выложить тесто на стол и вымесить руками в течение 5 минут (при необходимости можно добавить муку).
Тесто получается мягким, эластичным и совсем не липнет к рукам.
Положить тесто в пакет и оставить на 30 минут.
Фарш поперчить, посолить, добавить нарезанную зелень и измельченные в блендере лук и чеснок.
Хорошо перемешать, отбить и на полчаса убрать в холодильник.
От готового теста отрезать небольшую часть (оставшийся кусок снова убрать в пакет), скатать жгут, нарезать его кусочками.
Кусочки теста размять пальцами и затем каждый раскатать скалкой в форме круга.
На каждый кружок теста положить немного фарша и слепить пельмени той формы, которая вам нравится.
Выложить на присыпанный мукой поднос или доску.
Нужное количество пельменей отварить в подсоленной, кипящей воде с добавлением лаврового листика до готовности (после всплытия – около 5 минут).
Подавать готовые пельмешки со сливочным маслом, сметаной или уксусом, смешанным с зеленью и чесноком.
Приятного аппетита!😊"

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,Stanley is the bucket. And the narrator is stanley. Everything in the game but the bucket and stanley are real. But only stanley and the bucket are the only companions. Stanley and the bucket are in the bucket that the narrator stanley is holding. Which is why he loses his mind because he is the bucket. Him and the bucket are one being. But so is the narrator. Its him talking to himself talking about a bucket. While inside the bucket (and so the ramble of being a buckets bucket bucketing around a bucket while outside the inside of the bucket)
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"59:09 you can interperet these words as ""the end is never the end"" which was the original meaning, referring to the loop function in the game. But you can also read it as ""the end is never"" as in, the narrator hopelessly telling the air that there is no end to his state, his life, whatever it may be.  The other scary thing to contemplate, is the narrator immortal?  We only know for sure if he is alive by the fact that he is speaking.  So there is no definitive way to know that he has died.  He may be alive even when we make it out of the rubble after the ocean has dried out.  Completely alone for all that time, too stubborn to speak and let stanley know he's alive"

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"Oki, story time!

I started watching this late at night, like midnight

I got to maybe 30 minutes in before i rolled over and went to sleep, listening to it as background sound

Well, now its 3 am, and i wake up from an.. eh, lets say an interesting dream, to here 2:29:44, the narrator saying the Stanley really likes the number 3, and HAS TO show the bucket!!

I literally started laughing THE MOMENT i woke up, because of this w/ no contenxt

LMAO

This is the best thing to wake up to

""No no no! We cant go down yet, we still NEED to show mr bucket how SPECIAL the number 3 is, you DON'T understand!! He NEEDS to understand how special the 3 button is to meee!!""

Literally the funniest thing my eepy mind heard in forever since this moment 🫶"

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,I have made it and i am not lying
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,I watched this gameplay to feel a little more sane about this game and see someone else’s reactions to the endings- when 30 seconds into the video mark puts in 3:47pm as his time. which wouldn’t be of any significance other than the fact that that was the exact time I put in the game as well when I started playing it an hour ago. I think i’m slowly losing my mind and i’m freaking out
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,I have made it and I am not lying
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"man i relate too hard now to the narrator getting overly bothered by negative reviews rather than just accepting and moving on. i imagine the narrator is still alive in the skip button ending, but now he's just a husk consumed by his thoughts until even his thoughts become incoherent, unaware of himself or anything around him yet somehow still alive. also idk why but when the jim button said ""stanley"" that made me tear up"
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,Here we go
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,I have made it and I am not lying
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,What is the point of this game
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"1:55:00 The way that Mark plays the Museum Ending is an indication to me that even the great Markiplier is a subject of allienation due to society's overstimulation of (often hilarious) information, and thus, because of this ABUNDANCE of funny content, each single piece of content seems less and less funny.
YOU can see that in this ending by the way that Mark just simply cuts to the next bucket description and doesn't let himself laugh, or at the very least react a little more to the texts.
Granted, I played this part somewhat the same way, because I am also subjected to the overstimulation pressures of society that say ""MORE HERE... MORE THERE... AND MORE HERE!"", so I completely understand, but I would just have loved to see Markiplier react fully to this ending, even if the total video would have been 4 hours instead of 3,5. Not a big deal, if you ask me."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"It says it's the full game, but barring the things he already did in the original playthrough, there are certain things he didn't do:

* The bucket version of the Coward Ending
* The Heaven Ending and its bucket version
* The Cold Feet Ending and its bucket version
* The non-bucket versions of the three already accessible new endings
* The updated Games Ending where Minecraft and Portal are respectively replaced with Firewatch and Rocket League

I'd also mention the Art Ending, but anyone who can actually get there is a masochist.  I only did so in the original by skipping to it via the console, but of course, Ultra Deluxe isn't made in Source engine, so you can't do that anymore."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"this is disgusting.
its a complex game of escalator squash; of obstacle golf.
it is endlessly enthralling and intentional vapid.
extremely self obsessed.  
these self cyclical self criticisms make it so i know that i should be somewhere else.
the end of time, outdoors under the moon, under the hot sun and the howling winds.  a reminder to go outside.  to experience the unpredictable; the unscripted.  experience of the decay of the universe.  the beauty of a pine forest at night.  the love of people.
if anything, this is a warning of what video games can be.
an escape into a fake existence, an obsession over semantic feedback loops.
this game leaves the taste of putrid rot in the back of my mouth.
don't play this game."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"This version has a way darker tone I feel like. It's very different from the vibe of the first game , there's like a psychological horror aspect to it and tbh you kinda sorta feel like something is gonna jump at you at any second in some endings."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"i feel so bad for Narrator every time Stanley comes back. he explains how he's so lonely, then Stanley just - leaves.

also - anyone else see that the song 'just the two of us' was on the side where Mark looked?"
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,i haven’t made it and i’m lying
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,25:17 My brain when I:

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"Here in Finland we had a bucket factory that gave everyone free buckets. A LOT of people arrived to get one and it kinda became a meme. Might be a coincidence but I like to think that influenced this game.

There are SO ,amy other inanimate objects to use though. That makes me want to believe it really wasn't a coincidence."
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,I love that the elevator just made him go crazy
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,I have made it and I’m not lying
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,28:17 why did you go and do that
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"1:01:47 So I counted. From the time when the Narrator said that he stopped counting time after a year, Mark pressed the Skip button 12 times. Now, there is no discernible pattern to how long the skips take place for but since the Narrator said that each Skip gets longer and we went from 30 mins to 12 hours, to 1-2 weeks, to at least a year, for simplicity sake, I’m just going to jump each Skip to the next “measurement” of time. 

So Skip 1/12 puts us a decade later. 
2/12 is a century later, 
3/12 is a millennium later, 
4/12 would be an Age (2,148 years),
5/12 is a Terasecond (31,709 years),
6/12 is a Megaannum (1 million years),
7/12 is a Petasecond (31,709,791 years)
8/12 is a Galactic Year (time it takes the solar system to orbit the Milky Way, 230,000,000 years), 
9/12 is an Eon (1 billion years), 
10/12 is an Exasecond (31,709,791,983 years), 
11/12 is a Yottasecond (31,709,791,983,764,586 years), and
12/12 would be a Ronnasecond (31,709,791,983,764,586,504 years).

Again this is for simplicity’s sake, just going from one measurement of time to the next, but given it’s the Stanley Parable, this is as likely as any other calculation."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"The narrator never figured out how to make the button work. He didn't make a button that said the player's name; he made a button that said Stanley. He waited for so long, hoping that one day Stanley would wake up and get to press the button that said his name, and his name only. He'd never know it was just a trick from the narrator's part, and the narrator would never admit it was a trick made just to make Stanley feel happy.
The narrator never saw just how happy it would've made Stanley.

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"What makes a game to an artwork? I mean this question in general, independent of this game. The game as an art form reaches its highest reflection when it becomes its own subject—a game about making games. Here, it’s no longer just about playing but about exploring the rules, principles, and mechanisms of games themselves. It delves into the tension between freedom and structure, strategy and chance, control and chaos. Such games transcend simple entertainment and become philosophical tools that challenge our understanding of decisions and systems. Like a film about filmmaking or a book about writing, they invite us to analyze the medium itself. They reveal that perfection and predictability are illusions, and it’s the limits and imperfections of games that fuel their creativity and meaning. A game about making games becomes a stage where we, as players, not only act but also reflect—on ourselves and the worlds we create. But yea has anyone an interesting thought about that?"

What a wonderful experience this game seems to be. I managed to binge watch this entire playthrough start to finish in one sitting, and it truly felt like I never wanted it to end. Mark, if you ever manage to see this, you have been one of my favorite Youtubers since I started watching in 2012, and I often feel the same about watching your videos as I did with watching you play this game.

I never want it to end.

I have grown and learned so much in the last 12 years, and I can honestly attribute some of my current wisdom to lessons I've learned from you over that time. Thank you for being a friend that I will probably never meet or truly know but will always appreciate. God bless."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"am i really the only one that found the creator's obsession with ""preserving the integrity of the franchise"" was incredibly presumptuous and egotistical?
like i had zero friends say ""i can't wait for the sequel"" after playing stanley parable. it's a game that obviously was not in need of any more content.

so if nobody cares about more content, yet half the game you're crying about not being able to give people more content while talking down to them like their idiots (while making even more money off of them) just makes me actually kind of despise the out of touch game devs that worked on this.

like you aren't this special? no one asked for more? why are you crying about this for 2 hrs instead of making a game you want to make instead? if you're so intelligent and everyone is so stupid and easily manipulated, you should be able to make something without the title ""stanely parable"" and it should sell fine?

just seems so blatantly ego stroking to me, yet everyone i see play this just claps while being told their stupid for enjoying it. i don't get people."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"2:51:49 ""Stanley..I must Confess...I am not real,you're not neither,we are both im my dreams,we are my compressed memories,Memories that I've made to form a world where everything is okay,when we were all young and alive,when Mari was alive..
Oh Mari...
I need to tell you about her..
She was..wonderful..perfect..but maybe..too perfect..
That's it..she was too much perfect..you see,she was too occupied with her extra classes and her piano lessons,I felt alone,I missed my older sister..
I wanted her back in my life..
So that's why I've got a violin,so we could play together,spend time together..again..
But..she was..too much of a perfectionist when it came about practicing for the proclamly planned Duet of ours,we were supposed to play a bit of Waltzes,just a random pianist from the 17th century,but he was Mari's favorite,that's why she choosed that song for us to play.
She had to play her Omori piano and I had to play the Violin,
unfortunately,she didn't get that I needed more time to progress,she would get mad,like,enwrathened,at any of our failure,she would even sometimes get rough,once she literally smashed her head against the tiles and started to cry because she failed a part,whenever it happened,we had to replay the part over,and over and over,until we succeeded it,it was too much for me,I was pushed too hard,you see..?
Repeating the same parts,the tension it'd put..Mari's overwhelming behavior..
And that's why,the day of our behavior I..I've done something,something that,back in the moment,didn't know was the beginning of the end..
I threw the violin downstairs,thinking that it'd put an end to that misery,which was nothing compared to the misery that I had to go through after the incident,but I'll come back to that later..
so,as the violin fell,it made an obnoxiously loud noise,drawing Mari's alarmed attention,and as she was the broken violin,her arrival quickly turned into an argument,argument,which was the last interaction I ever had with her..
Oh Mari..
...
Do you remember that incident I was going to talk about earlier?
Then,this is it,
Because,as the argument was getting hotter,I..out of rage,accidentally pushed her downstairs..she died on the fall..
And since that day..
Every nights,whenever I sleep,I end up in this,as what I look like right now,in this WhiteSpace,connected to a world,full of compressed memories where Mari is alive..
It has been 4 years now since I didn't move from my home,spending my whole days,lamenting over the guilt of Killing my older sister,who loved me..
And 4 years since,like the pathetic hikkikomori that I am,have been dreaming about adventures with my friends..with Mari..
...
In this world,I am known as Omori,like Mari's piano..
But..out there..
Out of my head..
I am someone,you know ?
Someone who's lost in despair,overwhelmed by guilt,and who just wants to end the pain,and to join back her,to apologize,at last..
My name..
Is Sunny."""

Changes dialogue from ""Stanley"" to ""Stanley and The Bucket"" but after awhile, more and more devs start getting more creative ideas on what to do with the bucket. In the end, all of that snowballed so much that it halted the game's development for an ENTIRE YEAR and is actually the reason the Ultra Deluxe version was delayed in the first place. All because of one singular bucket..."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427. Employee Number 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427, and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month and every year, and although others might have considered it soul-rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley. Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No-one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say Hi. Never in all his years at the company had this happened - this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office"

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"The bits where you traverse the deserts and the fields, and where you get the test achievement, I never expect to feel such profundity in Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe of all games, but it gets kinda deep with the transition to the desert with the metacommentary on how we perceive the past with rose tinted glasses and it wasn't all perfect, and how time erodes everything away eventually when you use the skip button, even the concrete holding up the building disintegrates eventually, everything is temporary even concrete, so don't shy away from new trying new things, along with all of the other messages the can be gleaned from the skip button ending, like, damn that's so deep. You really feel some straight up majesty when you traverse the desert and instead of the narrator, there's the music. Kinda makes sense the game's creator's so capable of true profundity when you realise it's the same guy who made The Beginner's Guide which is even deeper, and much, much darker than The Stanley Parable, but still..."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"The i have made it, and im not lying part was so captivating, truly grabbed me by the gut."
The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"I have come to a realization about this game.

When the narrator goes on about needing a vessel.....

What if Stanley is the narrator. Someone so bored with his life that he is narrating his imagination?

A game developer at his desk, supposedly restricted in his creativity. Living through his dreams of making or playing a video game at the desk. The player is his invisible guest, or ""vessel"" for his narrations. 

Much the same as acquired DID, but much simpler. The ideals of simply sharing creativity. 

The game isn't a fever dream, or the possible ramblings of a serial killer. 

It's the story of the developer of the game. Lost in corporate policy and practice. And making this game in his head first. The game is making the game is making the game is making the game is making the game is making the game! 

The end is never the end is never the end is never the end because the end is making the game!"

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"I have been pretty anxious at school, hating how I'm acting, trying to be people I'm not just to get popular. I feel lonely due to my self hate. I worry so much about my looks, my personality, what people will think of me and all. it's crazy. I'm constantly comparing myself which just ruins my confidence. I have been realizing that being the ""cool"" kid wont change much. just because theres someone that may be popular and has good looks doesnt guarantee paradise. I try to tell myself ""nobody's the same person but I know that even they have things they hate about themselves. they're most likely comparing themselves to others at times. and just because I hate myself doesnt mean that others think I'm weird, that's my own fantasy"". so the best thing to do is to stop putting myself in that fantasy. putting myself in that fantasy is what's holding me back. I did a mental experiment and pretended to be a helpless person that was lonely wanting an awesome friend and I started acting myself around my friends and used myself as an example. that's making me realize that I'm not as bad as I'm making myself out to be. I'm not trying to be all positive about myself, going around thinking I'm great, cause I'm not a great person, that's the truth for all of us. but I am helping myself not be so depressed. I think I am becoming the friend I would've wanted. I just haven't realized it because I have been holding myself back. for instance, I would want a friend that's always there for me, not just someone to relate to, and when I did the mental experiment I realized I was always the kid that was there for someone that was hurt or lonely. that really changed my perspective. my most recent encounter was a kid that was actually lonely and he said to me and a friend, ""I honestly dont have friends"", that wrenched my heart so I replied, ""guess what, you've got friends right here"", we've been friends ever since."

The Stanley Parable,F8E3II0CYGY,"I’ve never watched Mark’s original play through of this game, only this video several times, and I swear I’ve thought of it at least once a fortnight since.  There’s something so whimsical and yet so moving about this game for me; the question of infinity, and letting go, and the importance of memories and their individual power. It’s one of the few times in my life where I have found myself craving an ending- because as Mark and the Settings character says, it is a game that spirals in on itself and of course, ‘the end is never the end’ - but it’s the fact that things end that make them so precious, if they were a worthy experience. You have to let the past be the past.
The whole design and storyline of this game, aside from all that, is gorgeous, and I’m trying to find ways to pay homage to it in my creative work for my Masters. 
I also just love this video in general; Mark is delightful himself, and so funny, and I feel we have quite a similar sensibility about the story. There are so many great moments and I can’t wait to return to it again."

He rushed through it so fast it kind of ruined it honestly.  Now that I think about it, that's true of the entire playthrough, really, Mark takes his time and enjoys it, checks small stuff out while Jack just whizzed right through everything"

You'll continuously have the idea that you're finding and exploring secrets in the game as you are stranding off from the intentions of the narrator, and it is enjoyable that the narrator has a scripted dialogue for these easter eggs, and that more often than rarely the easter eggs will have secondary easter eggs, with a scripted dialogue as well."

THE LIST - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_K3ziSxT9zcUUGCddS4sF1uNJTWHSbOwB1CQX2Rx4Uo/
Game has received patches which improved the performance issues by a lot for me. Your results may vary."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This is one of those games you think is gonna be generic and stupid and then when you finish it your like “I feel like I’ve been on drugs for the past 5 hours”
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,How is Adolf Hitler in your list of supporters TWICE?!?! 🤣🤣🤣
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I will get this on the Xbox! Thanks for the recommendation. ❤
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I got so addicted to this game once i got past the first day. Theres ALWAYS something to do and youre ALWAYS running behind
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"1:26 sometimes I forget that you reviewed Droods well after this, since I watched the original streams."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"It usually bothers me when a developer sends a game, because I can't trust it's an honest review. But listening to MandaloreGaming talk about this game, I could tell he actually does recommend it."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"You did, it you beautiful Bastard. The Bachelor is becoming a playable character in Path3"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I really hope Mandalore does Pathologic 3~
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"6 years later, still waiting for that Quake 4 review."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,21:00 I see you Neverhood Soundtrack
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"My only gripe with this game is the manual save system. If you don't have a lot of time to play video games and can only play in short bursts, it's impossible to progress, or at the very least you have to play the entire game focused almost solely around being able to save your progress instead of engaging with the game's other mechanics. It's so frustrating that they went this route--making the survival hard was a good choice, but when they try to control how long my gaming sessions are (usually about 1-2 hours between save points) that's when a line has been crossed. It also shatters the immersion because now I'm looking up a guide on all the save locations instead of finding them organically because I don't want to have to replay the first day 30 times before I find a save spot.

Alien Isolation pulled this off fine, but only because they had save stations every 10 minutes and the game is somewhat linear.

Pathologic 2 should have copied the Dark Souls method, which is to have the game autosave every time you do anything so that it's permanent. There's no loading a previous save in DS 1 because there's only one save and that's your autosave.

If they had done that to prevent save-scumming and make your choices permanent in that playthrough, that would have been awesome, but instead they used a manual save system that I despise and prevents me from getting into the game.

This is such a simple non-negotiable issue for me: If I buy a game, I should be able to quit playing the game and resume playing the game at any point with little to no loss of progress. If you punish me by sending me back hours of progress because i put your game down, f*ck you."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"People call this game ""Hard"", but I think it's more about being able to accept irrevocable and repeated loss while still plowing forward than it is about overcoming a difficult challenge. Not ""how well can you play"" but ""how quickly and thoroughly can you move through grief and continue on"".

Good practice for life."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,13:02 This track sounds like if VTM:B was set in Jamaica
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This was a hidden gem and we all just missed it
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Pathalogic 3 is on the distant horizon...
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This was a hidden gem and we all just missed it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,10 minutes in I said the wrong thing to three people asking me philosophical questions and my reputation went so low that I was instantly attacked by everyone in every town that I went into and I couldn't save scum my way out of it
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Guess what just got announced?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I litterally started playing in hard mode, idk would you Recommend me to go in medium for the First Time at least?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I loved the game but I hated the ending. I thought that just two endings to choose from was really bad considering how many choices we had to make to get there.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"after finishing it, i would not have finished the game without the difficulty settings. my god the survival mechanics was tedious and the random sand pest clouds that pop out for looting. i just wanted it to end near the end of the game, not caring about the npcs and just getting it over with."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"one of the best moments I had in pathologic 2 was when around day 10 I basically had to start killing indiscriminately to survive, I probably robbed more than 5 houses, killed dozens of people for their organs, soldiers, muggers, tenants, passersby, everyone I could, I was able to get the best equipment and a lot of food, I had to do like 4 quests in a row that were all in infected districts that were close to each other, even though I had the best items after becoming a serial killer I still barely made it out, I was basically crawling out of the area, masterful game"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Russian Stalker 2 (Hobo economy 2 included on every disc)
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,whats the track in the beginning of the video?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Recommending this game while getting to day four is considered a rare achievement is criminal.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Dunno how often you read old comments but 

Just dropped in to say, I stumbled on your channel via suggestion from yt, it threw your dangerous hunts 2010 video in my algorithm, and here I am, 40 videos into your chronological playlist (I've skipped a few), and I will say, you're the best review channel I've come across 

And I don't watch review channels 🤣 I don't watch reviews on anything I plan on playing, simply because I hate having things spoiled (especially so mechanics, and the things that make the game fun) but your content, is more like discovering lost gems than watching reviews. Your sense of humor is top notch, your ability to review is also top notch, but really I watch to find old gems I likely missed out on, and I've slowly built a bucket list of gems to play through. Limbo of the Lost, and Pathologic 2 are now at the top of that list lmao. Limbo looks like a mind melting experience, and Pathologic 2 just genuinely looks very unique, interesting, and thought provoking."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"PATHOLOGIC 3 IS BEING ANNOUNCED EVERYBODY, WE'RE SO BACK"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'll recommend this to my connoisseur gamer friends.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,STRONGHOLD SOUNDTRACK❤
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"24:56 and they announced the Bachelor now, we're so back"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Just a heads up, do not buy this on PS4! Those loads between districts or when entering a building are frequent and abysmally long. It's playable if you're extremely, extremely patient, but only just"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I remember about 10 years ago when i was looking for things to be hyped for on kickstarter. I saw this game and read through the page and absolutely wanted to play it. Several years after the game came out and i didn't play as much videogames as before. So playing pathologic 2 stayed an idea up to now. I'm learning game development and decided to buy and play lots more games. Just bought it !
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Will you do a patho 3 review when it comes out?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"22:54 IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT
(Context: P3's big trailer just dropped)"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,PATHOLOGIC 3 LET'S GO
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,PATHOLOGIC 3 JUST ANNOUNCED
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,25:44 One of your Patreons calls himself Adolf H.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I will never get tired of that Pillar Mime intro.

Just cracks me up every time."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Coming back to this feview after finally finishing patholgic 2 and has a wonderful time with it. Its a masterpiece
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Big fan of the dresses made from rags
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I played Pathologic 2, and it's not bad at all. Some stuttering here and there otherwise was well made. Unfortunately, it didn't click with me. I can definitely see where all the praise comes from though. It's got a unique world and game design."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Good news is that it seems to have performed well. Time (and reviewers) have been kind to it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Well, it's been 5 years. Did we miss it? Frankly, I enjoy with this game attempts to do. But even the brightest reviews make it sound like an absolute nightmare to play. I guess the appropriate way to say it would be, I like a challenge not a sacrifice."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,19:15 its the Klaymen track from The Neverhood <3
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"4 years late but I only found your channel a few months ago, gotten so many games based on your videos and so far I haven't been disappointed yet! 
I am not interested in playing every game you do a video on, but you do a great job of making it clear to me at least whether I would like it!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,7:25 not the fucking Aslan from the weird lovecraftian cult in the swamps of South Carolina
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I ido want to try this game . But i just bought darkwood yesterday im gonna finish that first . 😂
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I bought this game. Ive picked it up and put it down twice. This is my third pick up. Buy it you cowards
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"It’s something how renowned games like Skyrim and Dark Souls have become keywords in my brain to signal when I need to disregard everything a review says.

Dark Souls especially, bc it’s not difficult just to be difficult. DS2 tried that and as a result it’s pretty much universally hated. DS1 punishes you harder for being careless. (Or entering the game not being a DnD-holic and knowing what all those mf stats mean.) 

Overextend? Die. Get greedy and don’t attack with some degree of rhythm? Die. Wander into a higher level area when you’re not ready? Definitely die. 

Pathologic 2 looks to be sort of the dream RPG game. 

Stats matter, choices matter and to top it all off, you’re not a god.

Why is it only overseas developers understand how to do this?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I love Pathologic 2. When I got a baby and was streaming it to my friends, I didn't notice that I had full inventory. 
When I came to give it lady receiving baby said ""where"" and I frantically ran to get baby back

Also Haruspex is literally me IRL"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This is a game that is like a Unicorn to me... I very much want to play it... but I know that if I try to... I won't be able to, lol. "
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"7:27 Surprise Aslan puppet from the Dear Aslan episode of PST. Mandalore vids are the gift that keeps on giving with all the running gags, references and hints."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Sorry but I'll never support the idea the a game is fun *because* its hard.  Dark souls isnt fun for me because its hard,  its fun because you learn how to beat it.

This just sounds like its depressing for depression's sake and that doesnt sound like an appealing gaming experience. No wonder its not selling well. People want escapism, not this... thing."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Why is there Stronghold Music in the Background here? 24:00 Who thought that would fit the topic or capture the mood.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,20:00 They took that from Outer Wilds. Or the other way 'round.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Reminds me of the sinking city a little bit. You should review that
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,game is very artistic if you like survival games you realy gonna like tihis
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I just recently found your channel thanks to SsethTzeentach's video on wizardry 8 and I love how much of the old school games you cover and your style! Definitely subscribed to your channel!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,6:03 I think the was a memor leak problem early after release
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Рельсы — это красиво. Они всегда ведут к одной цели, и свернуть с неё невозможно."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,what was the game he showed at 21:13 ?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I can't wrap my head around the criticism that the difficult survival mechanics get in the way of the story. Pathologic 2 is an incredibly easy game, all you have to do is focus on your own survival and let everyone else die.. Doesn't affect the ending, and doesn't even really affect the story, even if a character survives they stop being relevant after they're at risk of death.

But you don't just let everyone die, do you? Because the game is so well designed it makes you care enough to do super difficult shit for them. That's genius."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,For some reason the first related video for me on this page is the Poker Face music video by Lady Gaga. I think even Youtube doesn't know what the hell this game is lol.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,25:28 / 27:01
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It's a shame how games which deserve money don't get it because we value mediocrity
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:24 I never noticed you put Lowry at the table.🤣
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The 2 things you point out as downgrades for yourself for me sealed the deal on the game as when i played it i truly felt like this is a culture that can actually exist.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I barely play games myself, but I've just seen a video essay on Half-Life 2 beta, and a comment mentioned Pathologic, and now I might get around to it. IRL I have a perk of being Ukrainian, so I could even enjoy it in its original Russian voice over!
- Adûnâi"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Pathologic and Pathologic 2 are games that I love watching videos about, but...they kinda suck to play. I know the dev (iirc, though it could have been a review of the first game) said something along the lines of ""games don't have to be fun"", and I don't disagree entirely, but games have to offer **something**. Pathologic/2 has a neat story and setting, but there's nothing in the actual gameplay that's worth engaging in, I wager sounding with a rusted nail would offer more in terms of enjoyment. I can see what some people like about it, but it's (understandably) a niche game that won't break into the larger cultural zeitgeist because it offers nothing that a video essay on it can't give you if you don't like managing quirky little bars.

Obviously, this is all just my opinion. If you like Pathologic/2, more power to ya, I'm not saying you're wrong for liking it by any means."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"“An open wound is a window…” 
My ass: “TO THE WALLLL”"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Watching this 4 years later is bittersweet. This game is woefully overlooked and such a work of art.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Ооо да, джоджо и мор в олном видео"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Mandy's reviews have this great quality to them where I appreciate them more after having played the game itself.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Nice call to add the Neverhood soundtrack in your video! Loved it!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,TRZFH-K55BM-L9E6P
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Pathologic 2 is like Fallout 4, and Pathologic is Fallout 3"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,There was one thing I was confused about. Does the steppe herbs cause hallucinations during certain times of the year? I thought I read that in the first game but I’m not sure.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This games narrative makes you care for everyone from key characters to sick npc, i love this game so much it inspired me to enrol in medicine to become a Doctor. 

Wish me Luck."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Ergodic Literature
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Fucking Lowry reference years before reviewing Mystery of The Druids. My man planned everything from the beginning
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"THANK U!!!!! I didn't expect the 2 being SO much better than 1!!! I'm so excited to play now! It's GORGEOUS and now i sense it's visually more like a legit game, the 1st was really a thing i was not accostumed to. The jump in quality and the author message also shows how pretty dang good and serious about game making they are. It's tragic we're not gonna get more, i was dying to see an improved version of Clara, i wish she was the next (never been so excited to see and play a female character i think). i'm shocked this game isnt a smash hit."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,18:59 It's so meta! You really are like something outside of that world. But i wish we dont get the sandbox stuff again.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"16:22 OF COURSE, just like in real life! Why i hadnt think this

16:38 WOW, and since you cant rebuilt completely you're like a normal person! You're muscles, you're system, are exhausted and you cant be back up before sleep, sometimes many days and sleeps."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"15:06 WOOOAAHH, BRILLIANT, OF COURSE. This also saves you a bit cause you could walk a long ass time for a place with neutral status where people dont know you and get stuff, only if gets too bad where everyone knows you and wont trade you're screwed."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,14:59 If they had some kind of Fagan or Varys system it would be interesting
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,22:44 This rebuttal is the same one Morrowboomers give to Skybabies. The goal is not making more distance between the world conflict and the characters but by shortening that distance for everyone. The diegesis is *the most important thing* in a story or adventure-driven game.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The mind map was actually stolen eventually by Outer Wilds and is perfect for its mystery plots
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Few hours into the game, day 1 . Mambo Jumbo random dialogues with no sense or meaning. Random monsters or ghosts around the town with no explanation why or what they r doing there. Horrible face models, wtf is this ? I love weird games like fear and hunger for example but..this rly is so all over the place it makes no sense at all"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"What makes games like Pathologic 2 and Dark Souls great is that they aren't afraid of the player missing content. In fact, they're designed knowing full well that the player won't find / experience everything in a single playthrough."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"6:51 For bonus weirdness points, I'm pretty sure that's a Pennsylvania Railroad Class T1, a stupidly fast passenger locomotive from the 1940s which has ZERO BUSINESS BEING ANYWHERE NEAR WHEREVER THIS IS"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I always thought it was weird when your REVOLVER has low durability and it jams, instead of pulling the hammer back you cock the slide back. THE SLIDE ON A REVOLVER!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,21:13 what game is that?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,That intro was golden.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Is that the music from stronghold at the end of the video?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The score by Theodore Bastard is incredible.  I still haven't figured out it's systems properly despite watching this multiple times lol but I won't give up x
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Jojo !!!!!!!!! 0:15
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The faces remind me a lot of VtM Bloodlines
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,this game literally plays you as much as you play it
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I have probably watched this video over a dozen times, but I have such a fresh perspective on it now compared to 3 years ago.
The mind map is in The Outer Wilds!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Text based review saying the game is hard ""Soulsian"" even lol don't think that was what affect sales, even in 2019 because held those reviews in contempt. What I believe happened is that usually when people think about the survival horror genre they expect some capcom style game. What I mean is that they expect it be survive a monster attack by combat and managing combat related resources. Hunger and other such meters are expect on survival/crafting base building genre, specially pvp ones such as Rust and its clones."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I would play this, but as I understand it, the events in the game are ""not real"" within the game world. Can't stand games like that. I don't want to immerse myself into something like that."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I bought the game because the story sounds cool, but I probably won't play it for a long while, as It's sitting with over 100 games in my steam library that I have yet to play."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The mix of tribal and industrial setting makes me think about cossacks or steppe people and the soviets
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"It's like the Dark Souls difficulty debate.
People championing for an easy mode have no idea what these games are about. Their difficulty is what makes them so great as they make the worlds that From Software creates so much more real and relatable. You get why these worlds are so desolate with little friendly faces. You experience it first hand when everything tries to kill you and it's no joke. You have to 'git gud' to survive and thrive in these worlds. It's honestly hard to describe exactly in words, but when you know, you know. But you did a beautiful job explaining how the difficulty makes Pathologic 2 so great!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Did the game get the sales it needed, or are we going to see it as a hidden gem in 3 years and we just missed it?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I want to play this for the story but survival games make me so anxious that I don’t like playing them lol
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I dont think its that Pathologic 2 is difficult I think its much more that managing your hunger is more akin to tending to a screaming infant than it is a fight for survival. I dont look at my hunger bar and feel anxiety like I do in The Long Dark I look at it and feel frustration.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The soundtrack in the end pulled me back to stronghold 2. Not a very good game, but i liked it 😊"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I tried P2 three times, and three times i gave up because there's no way to save the progress in any meaningful way. I hate having to replay long bits of game, especially a tough one, and P2 is a nightmare. You can screw up very easily, and it might force you to replay the entire day from scratch. 
I loved the atmosphere, the lore, the music, and i wanted to learn more about everything, but i just didn't have the commitment to suffer through the same sequences again and again and again, and i didn't want to cheat, because that ruins everything in a different way. So, i guess - P2 is not for me.
I hate games where you can't save anywhere, and i'm really pissed off at the developers that they still keep making them as if it was 1982. 
Since the first 8-bit game i ever played, sometime during the eighties, there was only one title where not being to save anywhere didn't bother me. And that was Alien Isolation.
All other games would only gain value by adding save anywhere function.
I would love to come back if they add save anywhere feature at some point. But that's very unlikely."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I love this video
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The Icepick Lodge game that I played growing up was ""The Void"" if i remember the name correctly. I... have weird memories about it. I think its the first video game I saw a tiddy in. there's probably more pertinent things to say about it but cut me some slack i was like 12"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,me 2 weeks after watching this video: I wonder what's pathologic 2 is about *rewatches video*
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I have no idea where you got the idea that this game isn't cryptic. You literally have have a scene where kids are grounding up pills for a game, both your character and another say how taking unknown mixed grounded pills are dangerous only for the ground pills to be extremely important. Then when you decide to play along with the madness turns out that was the wrong choice also even though you had no reason to think so."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I`m I the only one baffled by the fact that all the steppe women have boob jobs done?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I  gotta say, Pathologic 1 looked a bit too unplayable too me but this actually looks a lot more polished and intriguing. Coming from the olden days of games like Marrowind and yes even Ultima 8 I think it'd be a good time. Still one of the brownest games I've ever seen sense the mid 2000's."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Outer Wilds had a similar journal system to the mind map. It was absolutely brilliant. I 100% agree more games should have this sort of thing.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"never played 2, but played 1, my problem with these kind of games is that if you mess up early-mid game you generally dont know that you messed up and then you end up having to restart the game and replay it from start, immagine having to replay from start smth like resident evil each time you die, its not fun(for me atleast) I think this ""limited time"" setting works well for people who already know where to go and what to do, but it pushes away new players who havent watched several hours of ""tutorial"" ""walkthroughs"" on youtube or are not willing to fail 10 times in a row to figure it out themselves."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"23:47 Something you, and developers, really need to understand is that what makes this game great to you in fact keeps a lot of people from ever even touching it... and those that do give it a shot in spite of those elements get bored or frustrated and move on.

You cannot force a player to enjoy something. You cannot force them to experience the game the same way. That's why having options is a good thing. If they're not going to experience it the way *you* want them to, they can at least enjoy it their own way and get something from it.

Video games are meant to be played and enjoyed and being stubborn about the mechanics just because you have a vision for a game or as a fan appreciate the vision does not mean that you're any more right than they are, it just means you've become blind to the validity of the criticisms.

Can a bad game be good because of how bad it is? Absolutely.

It's still a bad game regardless.

The Dark Souls creators have this problem, as well. Does Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and Elden Ring benefit from its difficulty? Absolutely. A large part of their charm is how tough they can be and overcoming that difficulty.

Does that mean there should never be a way for less skilled or patient players to enjoy it their own way? No. They absolutely should be given options to make it more suited for them and when I hear the director talk down to that whole idea and go on about their vision for the game, I just want to shut off my brain and stop listening.

There is nothing wrong with wanting players to experience the game a specific way. _That doesn't mean you should force them to._"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I think you should cover total conversion mods on your channel, some are among the best games ever created in their genre. There's one similar to Pathologic - S.T.A.L.K.E.R. NLC 7 (Hard Edition 2.3)."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I found a really bizarre exploitable glitch (that I can't seem to find anyone else doing or noting yet from an admittedly brief Google search but I'll admit my lameness if this is well-known) by happenstance but I don't know how hard it would be to recreate since I haven't tried yet and I was in sort of a desperate position to trigger it:
So I got caught in this annoying loop where I had saved at a clock right before dying of hunger because I hadn't saved in forever and I hadn't died much so I assumed it would restore your hunger meter upon resurrection.  It did not so I just kept dying and returning just to die a few steps out of the house I was in with no hope of finding food.  I died like 9 times in minutes and got a lot of serious penalties when I'd been doing good for being new and on recommended difficulty.
Anyway I was in a house close to where the organ shop is and a blonde female child was there, I think the one that asks you to do something about the other blonde talking to the dead (not the magi lady, one of the kids she has a clock right next to her).
I made a dash for the boat worm guy, selected a location and died the exact second I closed the selection screen and I think the sound of him taking the token sounded.
I went to the theater for like a second then immediately appeared back in front of the worm with my health meters no longer functioning and my character seemingly immortal (I'm hoping I can end this by resetting or killing myself with fall damage cos time stopped too and eventually I'll need to start a new day but I need to try and make the best of this in case I can't recreate).  I cannot be killed by losing my health in combat either.
The biggest drawback (aside from obviously needing time to start again when I'm done exploring) is that the map screen and inventory and all that is inaccessible (inventory can still be accessed from containers, luckily) and none of the compass icons appear either and this game was already so difficult to navigate.  If there is a zoning committee they should be shot: don't they think it might be annoying and possibly dangerous that somebody has to walk a couple miles around another entire district to get to the building right behind his back yard or common garden to get to the building RIGHT BEHIND HIM A STONE THROW AWAY?  The roads are confusing too.
So sometimes when I enter a new district everything glitches out and all the buildings have their rough, half-loaded under-textures (it looks super blurry) and when this happens I can't walk through buildings and most geometry like walls and rocks.  The characters usually don't load there when this occurs (at least not stationary/native ones, but they can follow me or spill over) but its easily fixed by walking back over to somewhere that IS properly loaded, going indoors for a moment, back out for the other nearby districts to load properly.  I assume that either the glitch is interfering with how the game renders the environments as they're accessed or it's taking up too much memory because of interferences in closing stuff behind you, but I won't pretend I know more than I do about the engine or speculate too much.
It's actually come in handy because stuff like supply boxes still load and I found a couple I wouldn't have found, one was floating in mid-air, was inside a building I walked through and had some neat stuff but it had a note so it might have been one of those club caches the kids do, I hadn't found any of those yet so I don't know if that's what it was but I left some crap I didn't want just in case since that's the rule, to leave something in return.  I even fell through the map once in a weird hole that had some geometry underneath to catch me and I saw underneath, but I was able to hop back up on weird underground rocks.  I probably could have fallen intentionally, there was an edge to the lowest floor but I didn't dare at the time.
My reputation is also unaffected so I've been murdering people en masse, mostly guards and the 50 or so muggers: the first I'd even encountered, I think I'm still on night 2, maybe 3 but cannot check... hasn't been that long since the funeral.  What sucks is I don't know where to put extra stuff i keep finding (like 30 lockpicks ive tossed on the ground or left on corpses) where it won't disappear, guess I can take my chances on the boxes and trash bins.  I got the key but never entered my house, not that I know if that has storage cos I was trying to play blind.
Sorry this is so long: I'll just list the conditions that might be useful in recreation.  I think it was night 2, just around nightfall, in fact the transition might have happened around the time the glitch happened because it was still sunset when I kept dying, I think, I'll try to remember to review the video and check if someone wants more detail.  If not night 2, then 3, pretty confident on 2.  The worm was the sort of west, middle vertical axis one, I believe the one closest to the organ buyer and certainly the one closest to the house I kept resurrecting in: the house with a blonde girl sitting (behind a table?) next to a clock on the second floor of a small house on the west of the map.  I don't know if my timing in opening the worm boat map was frame perfect or second perfect even, as I seemed to be safe as long as the menu was open, but it must've been close because I dropped dead the exact moment it closed and I don't think your stuff drains in menus, don't quote me.
I want to restart the game to play the whole thing as properly intended and I regret that my first playthrough was the one I accidentally broke, because despair is part of the experience and invincibility/easy loot makes it feel cheap, but in case it ends up being super hard to recreate I want to try and see what all can be done and such.  Maybe I'll figure out how to upload the videos if someone wants this to work but is struggling and need of more specific detail.
Hope it works out if you're interested.
Sorry I can't be of more use in defining recreatability or an easy out for exploiting then turning the time back on, I don't want to bail on it yet if I can't ever do it again.  Surely there's somebody more dedicated and well-versed at these things than me that can figure it out.  I can't even get some of the Mario 64 and Dark Souls glitches to work.  :/
(Just copied the same post I made on reddit if verbiage seems off, I just hope someone better than me will perfect this and find more stuff)"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Now I want to hear Civvie review this game!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I'm only on Day 1 (and universally hated), but this game feels like it's probing my soul. Very few pieces of media, let alone video games, cast such a penetrating mirror on their audiences. I really dig it for cutting through the bullshit, if nothing else."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Hmm, interesting. I didn't have an easier time with liking Pathologic 2. I'd say they are both great games that are tightly designed with gameplay systems that fit well with story and atmosphere. 

P2 is obviously more impressive in the visual department, but first and foremost I was surprised how much the game manages to retain a similar style and feel in a lot of areas in spite of how much better it technically looks in many areas. 

The soundtrack is still good, but at least for me the soundtrack of P1 really carried the experience. Perhaps there was a lot of walking, but considering how much I liked the soundtrack it almost never got tedious for me. But yeah, it's very much appreciated that in P2 it is now usually comparatively clear what our options are. 

The balance of the survival mechanics was already great - not least because of the clear commitment to meaningful  and impactful and interconnected game mechanics - and as far as I can tell it has improved further. I just wish it hadn't made the game that much harder :D

I broke off the game (on intended difficulty) on Day 9, at which point half of my health was gone for good and I had been desperately fighting the infection for two days. I had given away the only cure for the plague I ever found to Sticky, bless him. And I hadn't been able to do the hospital quest on Day 8 and the nice woman in the town hall gave me only one food coupon... For context, that's enough for almost one egg :D 

But anyway, I want to encourage people to give it a try in spite of the difficulty and in spite of how stressful it can be. It's supposed to be that way. I even agree that the survival meters can really dominate the experience in a way that can push everything else to the background, which seems detrimental to some elements of the game, but I'm not sure how that seeming contradiction could be resolved without damaging the intended experience. 

It's fine to die a lot, it's fine to reload earlier saves and it's fine to lower the difficulty if you want to. I'll give it another try on the intended difficulty sooner or later and I'm uh... kind of looking forward to it ... I think..."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Russian voice actors are op
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"In difficulty menu the option for canon difficulty states:

""Pathologic is a game about catastrophe. Difficulty is one of the ways to tell about it.
By turning off the canonic difficulty you may calibrate the balance for yourself, but we do not recommend doing this on first walkthrough.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"After re-watching this, I came to the conclusion that the entire reason *why* the ""games are Art"" crowd loves walking sims so much is not in spite of, but exactly because of them not requiring any meaningful thought or input to get to the result. You can get all the gratification without putting in any of the legwork required to do so in an actual game.

The things the developer criticizes and laments are the exact same things that the ""games are art"" crowd loves so much in their walking simulators. You get strung along your nose on a linear path, because you cannot figure out for the life of you where you are supposed to go by thinking for half a second. Decisions are basically non-existent, as the entire point of a walking sim is it just telling you its story it has prepared, without deviating from it. There's literally no consequence involved, therefore it is risk free to feel good playing it: The cheapest way to score, even if not much of a high. It's the gaming equivalent of solvent abuse."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"A very interesting facet that you could look at regarding the NPCs not being 'varied enough' is the fact that they are implied to once more be part of the theater.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Sadly, games journalism has always suffered from the fact that reviewers tend not to review the game in front of them based on what it actually is, they review it based on what they think it SHOULD be.
There are extreme examples. IGN gave Football Manager a 2 out of 10 review because the reviewer wanted it to be a Fifa game and not a management simulation. A review show on G4 back in the day slammed Homeworld, an RTS game, because you didn't get to directly fly the ships and 'fire the guns yourself'.
Pathologic 2 is supposed to be difficult, it's supposed to be punishing, you're supposed to make mistakes and you're supposed to fail occasionally... but reviewers want a walking simulator, or an RPG where you can min-max and win everything.
Basically, the bad reviews and the difficulty settings the devs were forced to patch in is the result of a lot of people doing the equivalent of watching a slow-burn psychological horror movie and complaining that it's not a high-octane action adventure."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Aim for the neck because that's where there head is
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"1:03 в первой части на Горшка похож Пётр, а во второй Марк. Интересно."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,i liked the more minimal style of the first ost more
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The mind map concept impressed the heck out of me!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Dream sequences or visions in stories I don't really care for, but they're present at the start of the game...
I usually like Lovecraftian stuff and similar like Sunless Sea and Cultist Simulator, but Pathologic's brand of weirdness just didn't appeal to me."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I was directed to this video through a random review on the Xbox store. I wasn’t sure if this game was for me, but this sounds pretty interesting. I might have to check it out on a sale or something. Thanks!
Also, the soundtrack sounds straight out of an Ari Aster movie, which seems really fitting lol"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"i was able to play through we happy few and found sir you are being hunted pretty fun (though i just couldnt really figure out what to do overall, i know get the parts, shit gets harder as you do, but i kept getting all sortsa turned around)

tl;dr should i get it? im gonna be salty at myself for missing missions but thats replay-ability, no complaints there"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"26:22: Can agree with you, Mandy it's a hidden gem. A pity said initial low reception prevented an expansion pack from happening... may Pathologic 2 not suffer the same fate.


You're right, the Hannibal does have too much Steve Blum."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Still waiting for the rest of the content, and I hope what's currently happening in the world doesn't lead to the canning of the Bachelor and Changeling arcs 


Oh, and the Bachelor and Changeling releases better be happening all at once. *We can't handle another long wait.*"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Looking at this now, all I can think about is that this is the game We Happy Few *really, really* wanted to be."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"0:48 No
0:50 No
0:53 Due to the fact that the Bachelor's route will be released in at least 1000 years, then in order to understand the ENTIRE plot and all its twists - Yes, it is necessary

21:12 Actually, in the first Pathologic, we had a mission from Grief where we fought 5-6 bandits in the warehouse, so don't lie.
22:41 Here, too, you went too far. This would make sense if upgrading the inventory and the device required the same components, but this is not the case. Even more than that, the things needed for pumping are exchanged with people who need completely different  things. For example, a factory worker will give a gear for a chisel, and a seamstress will give threads only for immune pills. So your progress in upgrading your inventory and apparatus is not in “oh, you need to choose one thing” but in “oh, today I found a chisel in the garbage, I’ll go and upgrade the apparatus, and I’ll also exchange pills for children and go to upgrade inventory”"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I think the tutorials did the best at teaching me subconsciously what to expect when I was in the dream sequence where you arrive at your father's house and I was thinking, what kind of train pulls up right at the front yard? And then as I was looting items out of drawers and cabinets, I began to hear the laughter.
Oh, the laughter. And I knew exactly what it was.
I was being laughed at. I kept thinking, ""They're laughing at me."" Over and over. And I thought, is this yet another dream? Am I wasting my time looking for items? (I was) The Developers and their in-game equivalents were laughing at me. And that's when I knew this game would be a rich trip into the unknown."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This is an awesome video, and it's kind of made me obsessed with understanding the game. As futile as that is. Thanks for making it, keep up the good work!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This is like the greatest game in the FUCKING WORLD
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Did anyone notice the soundtrack from 'The Neverhood' (1996) playing at https://youtu.be/E7uKUgire7Y?t=1172
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"11:45 He actually doesn't say ""Hey, suka!"", he sais ""Hey, suda!"", wich translates as ""Hey, come here!"""
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"'discount Skyrim' has to take the cake.

What part of this game is in any way shape or form anything like Skyrim?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,A Russian take on surreal 90s point + click adventure games like Phantasmagoria.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:24  i see he's still defying gravity with them chairs xD
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""hunger is self explanatory, if you need that one explained, well, you're cat"""
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The enemies should say ""think you can take me?"" And "" don't forget me"""
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"you got sadist and masochist confused, again."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Difficulty is subjective so I'm against mandatory hardness, what you think is easy is hard for another. Historically it's always been hard for developers in favor of intractable difficulty to understand just how many customers they push away by not being more flexible about this matter."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Play YIIK, even if it's for halloween. It's intellectually offensive too."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I cant believe I didn't notice Lowry @ 1:25 until now
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I think the best way to describe this game is not ""sequel"" or ""remake"" but ""Iteration"". It's still the original concept of the first game and still acknowledges the first game exists, but iterates on and upgrades almost everything about the original game to make something new."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Sneaking is an absolute must in the Abattoir.  I got all of the O-Boyz that way...except for one.  There is one that will recognize you no matter what.  It's too close to the other one.  
The challenge in that instance is patience.  The entire game up until that point has taught you time is of the essence.  However, time in the Abattoir is significantly slowed.  So you have lots of time, but nothing tells you that.  It's quite jarring.  Another way they mess with you."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,nah both the sound and visuals are a downgrade. the buildings and environment in the first one had way more of a unique and creepy/atmospheric look and the og soundtrack is SO much cooler. way more generic and bland now.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,can someone tell me what is that music boxesque theme that is in the background of the video at the start?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Mind map reminds me of that conspiracy web from Prototype 1
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"It is just Far East Russia, and one of the a lot things game shows is how Siberia becoming industrial part of Russia"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I know I'm super late to the game but if you like the music shown here, a lot of it was done by Theodore bastard and I highly recommend checking the rest of their stuff out"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I liked it better in 2D.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Horse Archer Trip-hop is my new favorite genre
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Por qué no hay sub en español
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"People who want walking sims without the game part, need to quietly, feck off."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,i love the battle tendency reference in the intro lmfao
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,homed stuck
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,That JoJo reference in the intro killed me
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I think adding difficulty options is a better fate for the game than 90 percent of potentially interested parties not wanting the tedium and just watching a playthrough instead. 

Like I get art over capital  but ultimately pathologic 1 was barely playable to most people and even you actively criticized their intentional design.

It's also still a choice. Ultimately even if it didn't happen it probably has a cheat engine somewhere, and most people that are put off by the gameplay probably aren't going to be more immersed as a result of the difficulty."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The most enjoyable tutorial I've ever played
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,U shouldnt ruin the intro for people
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Just 7 months after this review, the story of a deadly disease breaking out that makes everyone panic, horde, and act stupid and crazy leaked out of the game into the real world.  :("
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Make album of fast rat magic?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Eyyy Sucah
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"It’s like the Zelda games. Same premise, different characters."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25 you sneaky bastard :D
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Wait, so Mands doesn't think that ""videogames are art""? Weird."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,one of the best games I played. had to use a trainer to beat it though because I couldn't manage my hunger + exhaustion though. It's too punishing especially day 7 onwards
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I wish I enjoyed survival games, this looks cool"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,stronghold music in the background ❤️
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,meow?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"What is that opening music? I mean, the bit before the jojo reference? Is it from the pathologic ost?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"1:25
I have watched this video so many times and I only just realised that you put Lowry from Mystery of the Druids in there.."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I remember binge watching every video on youtube about this game about a year back while I was working on my final art project and I finally remembered the name of it lmao
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,question: the ww2 shooter shown at 21:14 is something I used to play but now I can't remember what it's called... can anyone help out?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"To be honest... It seems like they took all the criticism from the first game and improved what they thought, was improveable :3 the result is amazing, also I love the fleshy blops :3"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Weird 1 frame text at eight min reads

Ikit claw alive in skavenblight 
Make album of fast rat magic"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,8:06
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Great review!! I love this game
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"1 year late, but super glad I've started playing this gem."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""Just like in middle school!"" Oh no"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Contradictions are carried over to Pathologic 2.  Pathologic 2 is both a ""sequel"" and a ""remake""."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"A trailer for the bachelor route was released.

Heres the link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sE7xSzDRZME&feature=youtu.be"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Finally got it in the GOG winter sale, having high hopes for this, thanks for the wonderful review."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It looks something like a mix between Russian Bioshock and Russian...   Amnesia? Something like that.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"25:18 - why I have an urge to be a medieval lord with constant bugs eating my beer plant harvest?
Oh, yeah, Stronghold"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,would love it on switch
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Laura ravel is hot
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game is so cool. I don’t normally like scary things like horror movies or games, but this game really pulls off the whole “more surreal than scary” thing. It kind of reminds me of the very strange and surreal feeling I get from something like Salad Fingers, but a bit creepier"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"What Are You Doing, Steppe Bro?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Trash Panda 2
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This is the kind of game where I'd buy it and then watch a story play through. Actually playing it would wreck me with anxiety.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Looks extremely weird; I'm surprised the reviews on steam are so good. Looks very odd, not seeing the fun from the outside. Maybe its one you have to try"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,">BG2
>Long

Pick one, BG2 is stupidly short if you know what you're doing."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"mystery of the druid sitting
1:25"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'd love to see a cash grab american movie based off of pathologic just to see how many things they screw up in just one film. Kind of like the american remake of utopia or those silent hill movies from a while back.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"its about £3.50 from g2a for steam, is it worth that price?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"1:25 has... LOWRY? Between this and haze, I wonder how far back some of these reviews were in the making..."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,What's the intro theme please
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Need to play that.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,damn good review
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"@23:43 im not sure if I misinterpreted this, or read too much into it. but it seems very strange that you mention the ""games are art"" crowd as the opposers to this game. I havent played this game, but after seeing reviews of Pathologic 1 and 2, these seem like very artistic games focusing on narrative over gameplay.

 people like us that enjoy these types of games, even if they may not be ""fun"" in a conventional sense, ARE part of the crowd that believes games are art. generally the types of journalists that hate on games for these reasons are actually against games being art, rather than being a part of it, because they're against artistic expression, and seek fun and playability over story and substance."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,What is the intro music?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"“Oh that organ harvesting, it’s so hot right now!” -Mugatumandalore."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I’m super mad about that budget Skyrim reviewers comments. I hate the direction gaming is heading in general and asshats like that are definitely the cause.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""Ikit claw alive in Skavenblight. Make album of fast rat magic."" Is... One obscure meme, my good sir."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I started this game one week before Covid
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,3:50 What is this? It feels familiar but I can't recall what it is.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""There's nothing like fighting a leper with a rusty shank and wondering whether he will die to time dilation instead."" This is top tier writing."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"6:51 Since there are 3 Karl's, I am guessing the game takes place after world war 2."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Coming back to this review is great but frustrating. This game nails post-death, repeating loop gameplay with great writing, atmosphere and story but got criticized for being a 'Soulsian wannabe'. Then in 2020, you see big names saying Deathloop is a 10/10."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I do love that you put the Sronghold 1 music :)
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It’s been two years……………..
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I loved one punishment that meant I couldn't hug any NPCs. I went yeah whatever but soon after one character specifically requests that you hold them for comfort. I never came across any other game that did that.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,3:00 ...well didn't know about that for sure.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:26 LARY
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This game made me want to buy a Jaw Harp
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The game journalism industry strikes again. Constantly bemoans the tedium of big budget banal games easy to review via checklist, slags off and tears apart smaller budget games trying something different for not being a big budget banal game easy to review via checklist."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This is like Covid-19 the video game lol
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Junji Ito's Mongolian Thunderdome LOL ""Two men enter, no men leaves!"""
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Is that the final saxophone sting from Klaymen's Theme at 21:39?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,this game reminds me of Dark Wood.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Outer Wilds, which came out literally a week after this game, also has a mind map! It's great!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This game is a pure masterpiece that is rare these days...
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Ikit Claw alive in skavenblight make album of fast rat magic
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Does anyone know the name of the game at 11:28?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,11:13 в русской версии бандиты лучше звучат
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25 Lowry spotted
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"So I finally played this masterpiece. It took 3 runs because I died so often I felt bad for the NPCs. This is the only game that made me feel that way, its really good."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Gosh the character designs are georgous
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Thanks bought the game just now even if it isn’t for me I like these developers truly doing something awesome hopefully I like it as much as dark wood
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,23:39 sneaking allows you to perform sneak melee attacks that deal double damage.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"23:33 not useless: allied guards wont mug surrendering enemies, allowing you to loot about half of their inventory before you finish them off and the guard grabs the other half of the loot."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""It Pathologic 2 a remake of 1?"" Yes
""Is Pathologic 2 sequel to 1?"" Yes
Welcome to explaining the relationship of Earthbound and Mother."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,21:13 What game is that?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Don't want to become a pathologic person by playing this kind of  game
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"11:45 he said ""Ey syuda"" or ""Hey, over here"". The second syllable is consonant for ""syuda"", for ""suka"" it's the first one."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"i love this game and my sister loves watching me play it, but i can't bring myself to play past day 9– the urge to save scum is too strong"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I wonder if the mind map in this is where Outer Wilds got the rumor mode idea. Huh

Also play Outer Wilds for your own sake"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,i definetly will buy this
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Some people see survival and fucking hate it immediately. They won't even touch great games because you have to eat and drink. The Long Dark is a outstanding survival game.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,its on sale right now. gonna buy it
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I just finished this vid after the video after the first, I also just bought the first game so wish me luck!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"1:24 you did edit that scene, didn't you? Or is this a Easter egg? I'm confused"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,i wish jarl balgruf were still here
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Thats what the point of the mask is
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"@1:25
I see what you Druid there."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"9:42
Does anyone recognize what this song is on the game's soundtrack?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I saw this video many times but I'm shitting my pants tonight seeing Lowry from Mystery of the Druids hovering in his glory at 1:25
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,What a Dumas!!!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,That non-creepy music reminds me of Nier Automata.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,05:08 Mustafa Kemal Atatürk ?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I actually recommended it to my uncle who is an archeologist and never played a game in his life. He absolutely loved it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It’s so quiet
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25 ....is that Larry? O_o
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I tried to play this game in my Xbox one. I couldn’t get past day 4. The little stutters you get when entering a new area were complete 2-5 seconds freezes. I just constantly brought me out. I am thinking about buying it on steam when I get a computer tho
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Just realized that Lowery is in the video
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Looking at this gameplay footage while looking at that of my own makes me realize just how poor my game's performance. The combat is especially a noticeable difference
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"11:47 no. Not ""hey sooqa"", but ""hey come here""."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This is on Xbox as well.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"tbh I don't like the improved graphics. That early 2000s 3D, grainy VHS look is perfect for horror or horror-adjacent games. The worms in particular just look silly now. They look like a comedy race from Stellaris."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"19:20 -CIV BEYOND EARTH? What the hell is -_-that-_- pull???- Oh, finally watched the Alpha Centauri review."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Russians have 3 types of games, trash, crack, or cult following"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Can someone tell me which song is playing with the guard ?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I swear the models in this game are better than some modern AAA games.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Metacritic shows why some people shouldn't speak about games. Complaining about game being too difficult is just so pathetic, especially when it was intended to be that way. People just dismiss everything without giving it second thought."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Can someone please tell me what he’s referencing when he says “junji ito’s Mongolian thunderdome”
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Jesus, it feels like they took a note out of Space Funeral for those spoken word background music."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Is that meant to be hbomb at 1:26? I don't remember any models in the game that look... Anything like that
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I didn't knew the stroghold 1 music ws free to use. Is it? Cause is great.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I, love, this, world."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The Music gives me the intense urge to colonize
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Oh its ruskii.. I thought it was French to start with it's artsy.. But yeah, definitely that ruski atmosphere."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""Budget Skyrim"" . . . Im sorry what now?
Whos out here making comparisons of a borderline supernatural plague survival simulator and a lite fantasy hack and slash rpg?
The most the two have going is maybe similarly monotone or drab visuals... That just throws me off."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Just got it and I'm having....a time. It is exhausting and hard and terrifyingly tense at times, but it's awesome"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I played and beat this game about a week ago and I gotta say, it's *definitely* harder than Dark Souls. After you play half a ng on any FromSoft game, you're good at it. This game kicked my ass every second of playing it and it left me asking for seconds. 10/10"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Mark Immortal..... that's the WORST name I've ever heard of

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The bachelor story is out now, hope to see an update like with the warhammer video for the DLC"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"felt like maybe checking this out at first, but now im completely sold on having to play it"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,When I played i just got so exhausted in trying to pick up on hidden meanings I just burnt out immediately
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,(:
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"So it is 11 pm here and I was on my way to bed, ""watching one more video"" but I had to stop the vid riiight at thebeginning x3"

*google translation : Hey you! stop right there!*"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,8:08 You say that as if that wasn't the story of the first game.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,What's the message that flashes on screen at 8:06 mean?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Wait... Was Lawrey from Mistery of the Druids always been there at 1:25?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I want them to make a Pathologic 3 primarily so that Mandalore makes a review of it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Was that intro music the Adeptus Custodes music?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"As to me personally, the whole game looks like a massive theatrical  piece"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Acessibility in video games is important and I think should be there, but it should be an option. I think sometimes gamers (not mando himself I’m not saying he is) can be up their own asses about lowering the difficulty. No, you’re still playing and enjoying the game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The living open posteriorly confuse because marble additionaly perform plus a perfect pimple. holistic, squeamish bibliography"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Man, I use Awaken for my alarm clock... I got real confused for a second."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Its not an accident that the ""game are art"" crowd loves walking simulators but hate this game. The people that love those games love them for the precise reason that they don't have to try. These people are the absolute dregs of the human race, so they will naturally love things that make them feel superior for their gigantic brains without actually having to do anything to earn it."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Tf lowry doing there.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,What were the tracks used in the music highlight section?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I love love LOVE Pathologic 2!! I wanted to play it so much I upgraded my computer so I could actually run it without my computer shitting the bed. There's so much love and work and attention put into every aspect and it's such an improvement on the original. i read that review you referenced and it's so shallow and insulting about the game as a whole it made me legitimately angry. people are robbed of an intense emotional experience because some blowhard refuses to genuinely engage with the game and writes it off because of it's difficulty. i'm really glad you, hbomberguy and sulmatul have brought more attention to pathologic and that ice pick studios are teasing the next chapter. i truly feel like we would have been robbed of such great art because of crap shallow journalism turning prospective gamers away from pathologic 2!! it really is that damn good!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""in pathologic two, they may have the same name, but they're a completely different character""
y'know how in one during the bachelor run on day two when everything gets pulled out from under you.
_what if thats what icepick lodge is doing with an entirely different game_"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,My only issue. The rifle is now modeled on the Kar98k or at least something close to it. The original rifle looked better.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I love how Lowry is in the theater before you even reviewed mystery of the druids
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,People will judge pathologic 2 and think that death stranding is a masterpiece.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"u made a small mistake at 11:42 In Russian there is no ""heey Succa"" that's just ""Heeeey S'uda"". S'uda means ""come here"" or ""here"". I'm just from Russia and like ur videos"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Things looking ""tribal"" does not make it non-european. All indo-european religions saw bulls as sacred to various degrees. The ""tribal"" parts of this game look very pagan, specifically European paganism since Iran has completely lost its Indo-european culture and India does not care for skulls as much as Europe did. The town doesn't look like a mix between tribalism and Europe, it just looks like non-christian Europe."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I guess you have a point about the difficulty enforcing the themes of the game and increasing engagement but you have to understand also that just because something is resonant doesnt mean it's going to go over well. 
If I made an artsy game about pain that comes with a special controller that shocks you every time your character feels pain I would be driving the point home REALLY hard but most people would probably not find it worth playing."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Stronghold music make my brain hurt before I could place it :D
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I feel like the graphics of the first game made it much creepier than this one. What is it with mid 2000s graphics that makes games so eerie?

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"hard agree about how the 'games as art' crowd seems to be at odds w mechanics. i think its bc a lot of artists who make indie stuff arent so good at the mechanics part and just want to tell a story... but my thing about games as art is that its a story you have agency in. its such a potent synthesis, the soulsborne hype really proves that. i dont think hard has to equal good either (eye divine can be cheesed with starting gear) but just... have some more ambition and curiosity! i dont hate walking sims because I know its a different kind of art and its easier for solo creators who just want to tell a story using a 3d space, I just long for the variety of having mechanics driven artsy games too. im a pretty Casuul player in non-competitive games but I still put in the work with pathologic and the soulsborn and whatnot bc its just... Soooo worth it"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I am apparently the only person on earth who loves Pathologic. I mean, I actually enjoy all the long walks, among other things. 

For me, Pathologic 2 is like an evolution of one of my favorite games and the complaints it gets (difficulty barriers and the tedium of babysitting the protagonist through the survival mechanics) are a thing I can see and understand but at the same time, these same people don't seem to understand what a game IS. I genuinely believe vidya is art to begin with and refusing to gamify the experience genuinely diminishes the ability of the piece to interest people as a general rule. Detractors argue that excessive gameplay cheapens the experience or puts a barrier on that experience but I contend that such is only the case with games suffering severe ludo-narrative dissonance (a moderate-to-high level of gameplay and story segregation.) What I love about Pathologic is that it eschews such an idea and makes the gameplay part of the story, part of the experience. 

This isn't a game about how a cycle of murder is bad but you go around murdering people anyway with little-to-no regard for the act; this is a game where you have to make hard decisions and deal with the consequences of your choices and examine why you made that choice: if those decisions aren't hard, if you have no stake in the world, if you don't have to work to survive like all the other characters... what's the point? You might as well remove the gameplay and write a book or make a movie. You can't have an immersive, interactive experience without, you know, immersing yourself in that unreal world and dealing with it like everyone else in it has to. 

For comparison, imagine a game of DnD where none of the player characters have anything of importance linking them to the world they're playing in. They will make different decisions, interact differently or not at all, than PCs that have something linking them to the world. Essentially, the players of such disconnected characters are, through their actions, saying that they do not wish to engage with the fictional world presented and the story being created, they want to just be told the story and then kick in the dungeon door and kill the monsters so they can divide the loot and repeat the process. There is a reason a lot of Game Masters are not fond of this kind of character and the player running it. 

A game is a collective effort, a story told by more than one person that others engage with and experience interactively, telling the tale together. Sure, most games (especially the triple-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa variety) are very shallow about this and lack a lot of that experience but a game like Pathologic or Pathologic 2 is a game that works the gameplay into the story. It KNOWS it's a game and it uses that. To not engage with it is saying that you don't care about the game or its story. At that point, why even bother critiquing the game? What's the point of judging something you don't give a damn for? 

Now, if there was an isssue where these elements are actually bogging down the game and just making a mess of things (a certain point in the life-cycle of We Happy Few comes to mind) that's one thing, but I've played both of these games and I don't feel like they have that kind of problem. Pathologic 2 in particular is something I would point to in order to show how to do survival games right. It has genuine issues but the survival mechanics aren't it. Hell, the difficulty isn't even particularly bad. I feel like people who make these complaints just don't want to have to think about the game and would be better off with something like CoD, Dear Esther, or the latest Final Fantasy."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I get the feeling that ""seeing journalists that didn't like the game 5 years ago now say it's a hidden gem"" had a very specific target.
Why am I hearing God Hand music?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""I like punishing myself.""

Yes i can see that. It might be the main reason why i never felt compelled to play something you review... ;-p 

But i will consider Pathologic 2."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25 Oh. I never noticed that until now after watching the droods video
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Me : **Coughs.**

The Doctor : 1:09"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Thank you for music from Stronghold!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Man, I love and hate this game. It's amazing, I've played over an 100h of it. The problem is that it haunts me and stress me out some time cause I'm so invested (I tend to save scum like crazy cause I want everybody to survive). So after a while I stop playig it, then my PC crash for whatever reason (not related to the game, my pc just sucks), I need to hard reset my PC (loosing all my saves) and I need to start again from the start to get to the ending. It's a testament to how good this game is that I've done this twice already. Also pro-tip on sneaking (the most important skill in the game that's never explained), always attack ennemies that are isolated by ''crouching'' by pressing C it will slow you down and you can kill any ennemy with two stabs of your knife without getting noticed (works great as a combo with the revolver if you plan on taking two ennemies on)."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I really respect how they made a game that sounds fantastically interesting and something I would normally never want to play. I think this video sold me a copy.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Can somebody tell me please, what's the price for the traveller's deal?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I seriously hope this game gets more love so they can continue working on this bizarre amazing piece of art.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I guess I'm one of those 'games can be art' guys but I don't like pure walking simulators. The reason games can contribute something to art is because they can interact with the player. Music, paintings, sculptures, books, movies, etc. all only influence you but you can't influence them. Games like this are art because they use that to for example immerse you into this town by making you face the same challenges. There's more to it than that of course, a game also requires a solid story and some kind of meaning to really be considered art but throwing out all the elements that make a game a game doesn't make it art, it just makes it boring."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"If you like the mind map here you should definitely check out Outer Wilds (not Outer Worlds, very different)...its probably naive of me to ask you to play a game without you doing any research into it but if you can take the plunge while knowing as little about it as possible I promise it will pay off!  Without giving too much away, you’re essentially playing a space anthropologist and the core gameplay mechanic suits an information web like this surprisingly well...it’s refreshing to see developers that understand what it feels like to be a detective (insert Charlie day gif)...anyways, it’s got great music, a fun cast, and a weird but effective tonal mash between a warm campfire and the infinite frozen abyss...it’s also got a super replayable premise - I’d bet you’d enjoy it and it’d be well worth your time 😎👉👉"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I want to play this or the original, I can't tell which to play, if I should even bother with the first or not, I feel like I would like it despite the walking and terrible combat, but idk. On top of that, it's all so complicated and the time element kinda freaks me out a little with the complexity and unsureity in mind. And top of those things, the whole game seems dark and grim, which would be fine, but with everything else to worry about it puts me off even more. Could use some advice for which to play (possibly beginner crucial tips).

I'm also looking to get S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl, so any advice or suggestions I could get of what to play or expect with any of these would be helpful"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,bruh... NGL this game looks really really good... better than 90% of AAA titles currently..

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Mandalore's og Pathalogic review is required reading before watching this video
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Of all the games to criticize for ""being hard just for the sake of being hard"", Pathologic 2 is possibly one of the worst choices. The stress and anxiety that comes with managing your survival is the most powerful way of tying you to the world of the game. As the townsfolk go hungry and starve, so do you. Your painful existance is being shared by all those that you see around you. 
And as you run out of time, as characters die for good, as you deliberate between completing a quest or keeping yourself healthy, the atmosphere that's been crafted through sound and visual design comes together on a whole other level. Its storytelling done through game design, and it's implemented brilliantly."

         ""AAHHHHHhHH!!!!!"""
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"That comment on difficulty makes it difficult for me to respect the developer's aspirations. The usage of a map marker does not constitute choosing a goal for the player. When I use google maps to direct me to a location, it didn't decide that location, I did. Having map markers does not imply anything about player choice. A lack of choice is a consequence of linearity. The fact that the developer doesn't understand this is a clear representation of not understanding how basic game mechanics work. The more and more I read about the developers and their commentary the more incompetent they seem. Never played their games, but from your reviews, it seems like I'd be smelling their farts throughout the experience."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25 oh shit I get that refrence now
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Wow never heard about Theodor Bastard making their own game. I mean look at this music video published somewhere before 2005. It is pretty a concept art for Pathologic.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Oh my gad....those reviews comparing it to Dark Souls and Skyrim are just the worst takes I have ever seen. Also Skyrim is the most overrated game of all time. It's actually garbage. Pathologic 2 has earned much better treatment.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Who else had bought the bull on their first playthrough? 😆
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I just had an amazingly disturbing thought.... What kind of game would these developers be able to create if given a AAA budget? A part of me thinks some of the magic would be lost.... But another part of me thinks they'd be able to be like CD Projekt Red and come out with a masterpiece.

But i remember not doing that here as my hunger and thirst tick away and my stockpile of water dribbles lower. Infected areas started popping up, it hit me. I know where I'm going, what road im on, where people live. Ive never been grounded in a game world, i allways see it as quest game or objective game. But i even cared about the kids, the little one in a safe house near the polyhedron asks to fix the lamp toy, ""at once!"" i thought, a spare cog on my person and it beamed the  house full of lights and stars.  The little one thanked me and apologised for my hard work, but it was there favorite toy and needed it fixed. I welled up, i cared for these people, i wanted these kids to survive the next week so help me, even when notkin or my bound got ill id dart home and grab my hoarded goods.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"imo it's fine to say you find a game too difficult, reviewers don't need to call the difficulty an inherently bad thing or a mistake. I find Soulsborne games too difficult, but it's not a mistake by the developers, it's just not to my taste."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I don't think Western video game reviewers care about interesting perspectives from other cultures. Pathologic seems so deeply rooted in Russian/Slavic culture, it's hard to imagine it coming from anywhere else. The reviewers don't like that dark, oppressive feeling of failure always looming overhead, with a small glimmer of hope driving you forward that Russian games seem to like. The reviewers would rather play the same politically motivated walking simulator over and over than step out of their comfort zone, both in terms of video games and cultural perspective, to experience something very unique. It speaks volumes not only to their incompetence as reviewers, but also to their shallowness and refusal to grow as a person."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25  druids video confirmed
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The developer of this game wanted people to like it so much.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Absolutely love you channel, but this game is just awful. I purchased it on Playstation Network for $40 and it was the first game, out of over 600 games I've purchased, where I asked for a refund (didn't get it.). 

Played it with my wife and teenage kids who felt the same way.

And it's not because the game is hard. I often play games on the hardest setting and beat them. It's just trash. Garbage writing. Could not hate it more.

Great channel, but we will have to disagree on this game.

But no, it's just that it took a minute to find the Jojo fans, I found them down below, I stopped scrolling after finding the 5th comment that references or points out Jojo's. The world truly is something, oh wait... I should try that again. ZA WARUDO!

But at the same time I can totally understand it, Reviewing the whole thing + 4 DLCs would take quite a lot of time, especially if you wanna show every main faction ending. Not to mention the game can be an absolute technical nightmare at times, I go back to playing it every so often and while it's still a pretty enjoyable, the bugs and crashing can take you off from the experience pretty fast, I remember that even though I had most of the bug fixing patches and even the 4GB patch installed I couldn't ever get the game to stop randomly freezing during loading screens, it wouldn't happen so often as for it to be unplayable but it still happened consistently enough that you knew it was coming at some point as soon as you started playing. So I can totally understand not wanting to deal with all that hassle."

The story intrigues me but the survival mechanics caught me off guard. I haven't beaten the game yet (made it to 4th day) already died over 5 times (intended difficulty) i recently changed the difficulty just to progress through the story. My biggest issue was hunger, i didnt know anything about the certain items to trade to certain people. It got so bad i sold a knife just for some food so i wouldn't keep dying only to die the same day. Its not that the game is hard neccesarily its just the game doesn't show you the ropes in game about acquiring things outside of looting. Im so tempted to just watch a walkthrough to see how the story unfolds because this game here 😂😂"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I wonder if they got mind map inspiration form Outer Wilds.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Stopped at a minute and thirty seconds into the video because I'm not about to be told a remake can also be a sequel. I'm sorry, but that is factually incorrect. The same identity cannot be the next in line to itself. It isn't the same as saying a ""square is a rectangle, but a rectangle isn't necessarily a square."" They are mutually exclusive concepts wherein if you apply to the definition of one, you are excluded from the other. Period. It sounds a lot like saying a square could also be interpreted as a circle. Which is pretentious bullshit. No.

Because to be a remake, it has to be the same identity, but redone. It therefore does not make it a sequel. 
A sequel on the other hand, can have elements of the prior game included in the story, including entire sections retold or re imagined in other ways. It can include large full chunks of the prior game as part of the telling of the next story for context, or some such reason...but that doesn't make the sequel a remake of the prior separate game. 
I'm very sorry, but you have lost me on that one and you get a dislike from me. This is one of those things that when you hear it your eyes squint like you tasted something tart and heard the squelch that goes along with it."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It's on Game Pass now so people should really check it out
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,So its like Evil Dead 2 being a sequel and a remake of Evil Dead?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I know 3:1 being a big deal is unusual for a video game, but, weirdly, I’ve found there is a huge jump in the severity of a beating from two compared to three people. Mostly it’s because you can’t possibly see everything coming and cover up in all the necessary directions with a third person in the mix. Trying to take on three people is just a good way to get a bad beating. But hey, as long as they don’t get carried away kicking you once you go down, and nobody is armed, you might not end up as an inpatient - or dead. If even one of those three can handle themselves and they want to cause some serious damage, you are absolutely hosed. In that case, if you can’t get away, the difference between two and three people can come down to wishing they would stop, versus being relieved you will be unconscious soon. That’s a horrible feeling without question because at some level it registers that you are going to be totally helpless and might die. In outcomes, it is the difference between going to the ER for stitches and splints for your fingers, and coming to consciousness in the hospital, trying to vomit and discovering that you have a chest tube, monitor leads, IV, and a cast making it hard to sit up. Just my two cents from my experiences making poor choices of friends during an ill-spent youth stationed in some less than genteel places, and medical training in some of the same later in life."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Video games critics are not critics. They either, “love” video games, or are trained journalists. Very seldom are video critics really understand and appreciate criticism and video games at the same time. Critics are most valuable when they serve as guidance to what’s new and why it’s important. Strange, quirky but passionate games like Pathologic are the livelihood of critics, because unlike the masses who prefers comfort and mundanity, critics actively tries everything, experience everything so they can get a good grasp on things that are brave, daring, new, ahead of their time. That critics from Ratatouille gave a simple speech about critics that explains their role so well, it’s amazing that video games critics still don’t get it. People like Yahtzee criticise, hating the mundane, yearly releases not because they hate video games, but because they truly, utterly loving the medium, and it is an elusive beast. Video games critics have to sign themselves up to see video games as an art form, else there’s no meaning in their work. We don’t exactly have critics for washing machine, we have “reviewers” who can tell you if the features are good or necessary, or if the price is worth the investment. Those are not the same as critics, because the critics have to use their own preference to explain why something is valuable, as art is subjective. Critics view opens the mind of readers to a new dimension, somewhere they have not been before, and it’s important for video games because for half a century of its existence, video games are still deciding whether they are arts or toys. We might dismiss that question as “of course it’s art”, but the difference is you should draw an equivalence to statues only made in human shapes, or paintings only made up of 2 colours. To only have art elements or gameplay elements makes video games as such. Video games are both, in my opinion, and it is important for video games that can do both to be praised and appreciated, because those games pushed the envelop for what video games can be. Gameplay and story integration is the unique aspect of video games. No other mediums could even come close to what video game is capable of and to me it is the reason why video games is superior to all other mediums we had thus far. Take Pathologic survival mechanics. Saving people give you more stories, dying give you extra dialogues, retrying is akin to, well, waking up in the theatre and such. A game that can do this so well blows every low effort walking simulator out of the water, because the makers of walking simulators are up in their ass about art, but are actually incapable of harnessing the medium. An example is David Cage who couldn’t make it in movies, turning to video game instead. The man had many good ideas but video game is such a tricky medium, he couldn’t do it well in the end. It’s inevitable that shit sites like Gamespot and IGN who views video games as only toys would survive, because the toy markers are keeping them alive, and they have strong backings. But, I do believe that the internet will fill that void with people like Mandalore/Seth, Yahtzee. I hope they remain the pillar of the video game criticism. We need these men to stoke the fire of creativity, and keep it going."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Guys, you can subscribe to IcePickLodge's YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/IcePickLodge"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Mainstream games criticism is shit and has been shit since forever because it has always been connected at the hip to games marketing. Magazines made to promote a company's games and consoles added ""review"" sections which were and are thinly veiled promotions rather than subjective and critical reviews from real critics. When games magazines transitioned from print media to online websites nothing changed. Instead of being tied to one specific brand or company, gaming websites advertise for as many publishers as possible. Is IGN going to bash the shitty EA title filled with predatory micro-transactions and broken mechanics? Hell no. They are on EA's payroll. So game critics are laughable because they have NEVER been critics to begin with. They are PR guys and promoters pretending to do game criticism and journalism so that the sale figures can possibly increase by .5 percent. But you can't be too harsh on them because when they actually try to branch out and do real criticism and journalism, big publishers will revoke press access, refuse to give review copies or outright ban or even threaten them directly. 

So the source of the problem, like a lot of things, is capitalism. Games sell better with good press and review scores. Game publishers own and control big game review and news sites to put out favorable reviews and articles. When the tiniest prospect of real mainstream game journalism rears its head the publishers viciously stamp it out of existence before it can even begin to threaten their bottom lines."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Finished it first time just shown off stage.how do I get another ending can I go back a save to day 10 or restart?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,tbh. I think that this game isn't something for me.... I like to read about these stories and not play them... but I think I'll have to buy it only to give them some money for their awesome ideas and usage of their ideas. ( I watched it online and therefore experienced the story elements)
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I think a lot of the poor reception comes down to the fundamental difference between the conditions of professional review against enthusiast review. Pathologic 2 is deliberately, wilfully oblique, actively fights against you getting into it, and if you don't have the context of playing the first game or getting over halfway through the second, you have no reason to assume that unlike the last 99 games you played that were obtuse or janky because they were badly made, this one is obtuse and janky on purpose to generate an express narrative experience.
If you're playing it for your own fun, or doing enthusiast review where you can walk away from anything you don't care for and just do something else, the 80-90% of people who are going to have such a bad time with the start of the game that it's not worth it to get to the point where it starts properly paying off it don't have to, and those who can get to have a unique and valuable experience. The process self-selects for people who do value what the game has to offer, offers assurance that the game has features in common with awful games for an actual justified reason, and selects out people who would not find that trade-off worth it. Nobody who doesn't find this a great thing is going to tolerate playing the game long enough to make an in-depth enthusiast review. The reviews will reflect how good the game suits the fan population plus people who bought it by mistake - which the user views accurately do.
If you're playing it professionally, you probably have three days to play a game that got tossed on your desk, or best-case tossed between three of you and the other two refused. You've definitely played far more crap jank games than an enthusiast and you don't get to stop playing when you stop having fun until you have enough material for a review, and that means you have a far stronger association between the mechanics used in Pathologic 2 and terrible games. Obtuse mechanics that make the game more frustrating to play and block off the 'good stuff' are more frustrating when after a certain number of hours you're burning your own free time to play a game you were made to play. And unlike self-selecting players who have most likely played or at least watched Pathologic before, the odds of a reviewer stuck with the game having played a very obscure title are slim. Plus, people telling you 'you'll like it more if you played the first one' are telling someone frustrated with how obtuse the game is that they have to spend another eight hours watching someone else play a completely different game to stop this one being bad - which obviously won't come across well. These reviews are going to be a lot closer to the opinion of general gamers towards the game - which they do accurately reflect.
It's akin to the difference between reading a classic book because you chose it, or because it was assigned to you at school. I had a great time with the Count of Monte Christo and Moby Dick when I read them by choice on a long holiday, but if I had been ordered to read them on a deadline it'd be a miserable experience."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The reason the culture is so strange is because it’s not just one culture. It’s at least two, those being Russian and Mongolian. When people think of Russia, they usually think of western Russia and Siberia. Pathologic takes place somewhere in southeastern Russia, where it meets the Mongolian steppe. The game presents these two cultures clashing with each other frequently, and the three playable characters(or at least the planned ones/the ones playable in the first game) represent one or the other or a mix. The Bachelor is purely scientific, representing modern Russian science. The Changeling uses mysticism, similar to the traditions and folklore of the steppe. And the Haruspex is stuck between the two, a man who hails from the steppe society, but who went west to become a doctor. It was a great choice to pick the Haruspex as the first character released, because players could experience both cultures if the other two characters are never released."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I hate how so many in the games are art crowd don't actually want to appreciate games AS art. All they want is a pretty landscape and a story to piece together, they have no understanding of what makes games unique as an artform, their interactivity, and yes their CHALLANGE. The unique challenges that a game can present to you as a player goes so much further towards legitimizing games as art than any other element beceause this is the most unique thing that they have to present to the player.

It would be like marching into a restaurant and claiming that the food their is not art, because it tastes and smells amazing, but doesn't look like the kind of thing you might see in food photography. I am thoroughly on the side that games (I.E. Individual games) can be art, but my opinion is anyone who claims a games challenge is getting in the way of it's more traditionally artistic elements is an uncultured swine upon whom the brilliance of genius game designers is utterly lost. This is why they enjoy the kind of pretentious navel-gazing simulators with vapid storylines designed purely to stroke the ego of smooth brained ""intellectuals"".

Sorry that got a little pretentious and judgy there, it's just I can't stand what passes for art nowadays while true brilliance is left unrecognized. Yes I am an artist, no I don't mean me when I say true brilliance, my work while I would not discount it entirely, looks like pedestrian stick figures compared to the wonders I have seen many other utterly unrecognized artists create. It just, well, it sets my sense of justice alight with an inexhaustible inferno of righteous indignation! Sorry... just had to get that off my chest it seems."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"There's a channel called instig8ive journalism which once had a video critiquing bioware and the defenders of ME 3's ending as people who misunderstood what art means. to this date i think no one else has ever put it more gracefully than he has. he basically accuses them of laziness in making the effort to appreciate the artistic value of any piece of media, and this causes them to flock to a particular example as it represents their idea of what an art looks like, rather than understanding what art really means in the context of video game as a medium. it explains why they use buzzwords like ""cinematic"" or ""the dark souls of"" and ""like skyrim with"". 

every single video on his channel was great and I highly recommend watching them for those who weren't there during the peak of the shitstorm.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The game was just annoying to play and more frustrating because it was actually engaging. If your character isn't thirsty, they are tired, if they aren't tired, they are hungry, if they aren't hungry, they are infected, if they aren't infected, they are injured. If they aren't any of that, you are forced to haul ass across town to get the stuff that prevents from being thirsty, tired, hungry, infected or injured. 

The biggest bullshit was the shortening day-cycle. It's like...do you want me to play your fucking game or not??? Oh yeah, it's realistic, i forgot, that's why a SCALPEL - you know, those things made out of fucking titanium - is breaking after shanking a dude four times. 



I've restarted it about a dozen times and still constantly got fucked over by some bullshit or another. I want to do all the quest and rescue all the people, because guess what - games are meant to be escapism, not a reminder that the world is shit and you can't do anything about it."

Now devs improved game's performance a lot and its almost a perfection - combat is still clunky, but the atmosphere, music, design and story are breathtaking. i hope people will notice this game and give it a try since this is truly a unique experience, and i hope we will see other character routes as soon as possible."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Own the game on PC and it runs well on there, but was wondering what all of those minor ""hitches"" were throughout while walking around town. After playing both of the console ports (Xbox One X and on PS4 Pro) it's clear to me that the hitches are points where the game is loading the next zone in town. By the way, the console ports are barely playable due to a terrible framerate and constant, long load times. Really disappointed Ice Pick Lodge weren't able to make good ports, this game deserves as much exposure as possible, they did a fantastic job with this and the original capturing what happens during a pandemic."

(Maybe not so) Funny fact is: The second game was supposed to have come out in Fall 2016. Can’t blame Dybowski and the crew for wanting to make more improvements to the game, especially since they did make some good use of the extra time they took. It was worth the wait, but still, the fans like yours truly had to wait for three more years before the game finally clawed its way out of development hell."

That's really sad for a number of reasons but what's even more sad is when you said the game wasn't doing well. I had no idea P2 looked this good and I was borderline furious when you brought up peoples complaints. When small teams remake their cult classic hidden gem and improve on almost every aspect with no anti-consumer policies that are typical of modern gaming, we as a gaming community need to prop it up as an example of what we expect. Even if someone doesn't enjoy the game, they need to at least acknowledge the good it does for the industry. This to me, redefines standards."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I completely get the ""it is hard"" criticism. Most people work 8 hours, sleep 8 hours and have 8 hours to eat, commute and entertain themselves. If you find this interesting game that has a gripping narrative and well written characters but you have in the middle of it some boring survival game then it is understandable you are gonna want it out. Some people like hard games but that is not gonna be for everyone so if you are surpised this obscure, niche game is not selling well I dont know what to tell you. The author can have their artistic vision and the user can tell them to go fuck themselves with their pretentious garbage, it is a tale as old as time.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I think I might die tonight.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"From watching this, I'm really glad that this game exists, but it doesn't seem like my cup of tea"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I don't think I would play it (I tried Path. 1 and the Void). But I like that they won't compromise or ease players in, don't hold hands and such. Even if it isn't for my taste next time around there will be some different game from risk-taking and avant-garde devs that does fit. The attitude counts."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"There's a very good reason I don't look up reviews from ""game journalists"" and this just shows peak example. They're all brainless, thought marred, base fuckin' bunglers. If I want a review of something, I know I can come to youtube where, at least, most do it for free or on their own time so they're more honest instead of just pushing some garbage out the door because they weren't paid to praise it endlessly."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Make the Void  review
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Tried it on the game pass, and eh maybe ill go back but it was very janky, gave me vibes of an old game and im only 20 so halo is about as old as i grew up with so theres not even a nostalgia factor. 
I have before tried games and thought they were janky only to later love them a.k.a the witcher, so who knows"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"hey thanks for introducing me to this game, I streamed it for 33 hours total now and ive been having fun"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,*IT'S QUIET*
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I think playing different characters is an amazing aspect of the first game
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This is free on Xbox game pass now I downloaded it and maybe give it a try.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"In fairness, I don't think 'Soulsian Difficulty' (even if that sentence does make me wince) is necessarily far off the mark. Both Dark Souls and Pathologic seem like they're trying to use difficulty in the mechanics to convey a narrative attitude. Dark Souls is oppressive and futile because everything wants to murder you, Pathologic is a struggle to survive both mechanically and narratively."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I noticed when i block in combat it looks like a slideshow even though im at 60 fps
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"25:06 We all were there, don't worry."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Ah yes...
playable russian literature"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Hmm at a glance this looked to me just like a straight remake and I had found Pathologic1 to be too tedious and woudln't want to replay the hobo simulator (also part of the atmosphere and design uniqueness is certainly lost with the new art direction). But if they improved and redesigned the systems to make it fun and engaging to play, like you say, then I need to give it a try."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Eh, i am all for having at least 2 difficulties for your game. Sometimes i just wanna experience the story, especially in games with boring or bad combat or that require too much grinding to stay alive, and that's when an easy difficulty setting comes in handy."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Pro tip: Lockpicks near breaking point (on it's last hit) will insta-kill anyone and anything & break.
Also, a big shout-out to Marshall Dyer. He's a real great story-oriented youtuber and very competent when it comes to puzzles and mysteries.
He even did all three playthroughs of the first Pathologic game and two full playthroughs of Pathologic 2 so he's hella dedicated.
He deserves more views, likes & subs for the quality content he uploads on his channel of which he uploads DAILY content for.
...
Please don't delete the comment, Mandalore-sama. I still like your content. :3"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"How do I even play this game. It feels like all the NPC are high on something, everyone is talking nonsense."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This seems like a considerable upgrade to pathologic, and gives me some hexen, clive barker's undying, and half life 2 vibes. Edit; I forgot to mention some segments, especially the night segments, are very reminiscent of amnesia; the dark descent."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Huh? In many games playing good means usually better stuff in the long run. Sure stealing and screwing over npcs gets you more money, but typically if there is affinity type system, rewords for good deads tend to end up better in the long run."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Someone can tell me if it's possible to have this game in french ?

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I feel like this is why game's journalists can be problematic. For games with a niche audience, which are only designed to appeal to a smallish crowd, if none of the relatively small group of major games journalists happen to be into that, it will get bad views and poor exposure that it really doesn't deserve. This is especially true in emerging genres."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,these back dudes look like chin chin from filthy frank
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I wish it could be on console... but i doun't know how the controller would work?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"You know, it occurs to me that the 'games are art' crowd might prefer so-called walking simulators... *because they can actually finish them* in a timely manner. Whereas games like this are locked behind a difficulty wall they might not have to time to overcome. Not to mention that difficulty is highly subjective, and what is really difficult for some is easy for others, and vice versa quite often."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"21:36 Man, *fuck the worship of difficulty*, fuck it right off, I'm sick of it, I don't want an easier mod anymore, now I want a god mode, because fuck you. I've had it with snooty shitheads pissing and moaning because other people don't necessarily like to play games exactly the way they like too and don't understand what the sunk cost fallacy is.

23:44 I can't speak to those other reviewers but this game seems like one huge fuck you to the player... I'm not sure why I should pay for that. Maybe you need all that stuff to get invested, but not everyone is you. I, find things like that incredibly tedious and distracting, it breaks me out of the experience and just makes me think about how the game designers are telling me to 'git good'. Like, you talk about how without those meters you have no reason to go into a random house to see how people are doing... You mean you wouldn't go in there just because you're curious, or engrossed in the narrative? Because those meters just remind me how the game designers are fucking with me and then I'm not connecting with anyone or anything because I'm concentrating on those fucking meters.

Now to be fair, I haven't played this particular game, so maybe it's different, but I've been burned enough that I'm not willing to front up the money to try it out. I'm pretty short on both money and free time these days and I don't have much patience for games that wast what little free time I have."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The second you mentioned that more games should borrow the Mind Map mechanic, I looked up whether you talked about Outer Wilds yet. 
That game uses a mechanic like that, and just in case you haven't gotten around to playing it yet, you definitely should. Not talking about the Obsidian game here but about that other indie game.
(If you somehow haven't heard of it yet, please don't look anything up. The less you know the better.)
One of the most amazing games I've experienced yet. And it really offers something different that would probably be up your alley."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game sounds so cool, but I'm a big baby, so I don't think I can handle playing it. Maybe I'll buy it and grow enough of a spine to play it one day... Really want interesting games to do well."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Do Turgor review, it's from same developer"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Brilliant review.  Really accounts for the depth and uniqueness of Pathologic.   This and Pathologic 1 are in their own league of uniqueness and bizarreness.  Great to hear that Pathologic 2 addresses concerns of 1 and adds layers upon the complexity.   I am 100% getting this game.  Also the writers of this game please dont quit even if your game did not sell huge amounts.  Remember trying to dumb things down to appeal to everyone in the end appeals to no one.   Just embrace your own vision and if they are smart enough to appreciate your genius then good if not then their loss.  History will remember.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Thanks for not only raising awareness, but also detailing the narrative. Pathologic 1 and 2 are games I always recommend, but know i'll never be able to beat as survival mechanics are not my forte. All attempts to beat Pathologic 1 failed miserably and withered me off of playing 2, even after turning to guides and my mind numbing to the tedium of walking even though the themes, setting, mystery, horror, and alien culture/music sold me on playing regardless of my survival shortcomings months before finding your videos. Just goes to show that no matter how much you love something, it's harder to appreciate it if it requires faculties that are your flaws. I buy copies in hopes of supporting Ice Pick Lodge even though I won't play them, but thank you for giving narrative summaries so I can at least enjoy a filtered version of the narrative that I know I will never be able to access. In some ways, it also helps me come from a place of understanding for the journalists who reviewed the game, even though I severely disagree with their conclusion."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Well - the ""Games are Art"" crowd is nowadays full of hooting dickbags: simple as that.
Case in Point - trying to say this game is ""soulslike"" and a ""budget skyrim"" in the same text would be grounds for a firing squad at this rate. These are the people that genuinely would go into one of those newer ""art"" galleries where there's just a heap of junk on display and go ""ohh, this could mean such and such, but also something else entirely, what a piece of art."" - absolute degenerates. Art used to be something that clearly depicted something - let it be a message, a depiction or an idea, with an underlying current or a hint of something grander. Nowadays it's all going the ""what could it all mean?""-route while doing handwaggling gestures. When strokes this broad could mean anything, they mean absolutely nothing anymore.


You sure went above and beyond to actually give this game a fair review when idiots love to pan it because it's nothing like established games that try something similar: namely conveying a message first and foremost. This game is meant to be dreadfully difficult, because it's a means to an end. That end not being artificial difficulty for the sake of difficulty, but the oppressive feeling of being stuck in a dying world with barely any hope to cling to and still making it through using tough decision-making. On that note, it actually is like Dark Souls, but that's about it. Going ""Ohh it's like Dark Souls because it's difficult and Dark Souls is also difficult"" is intellectual dishonesty if I ever saw some and I can bet my left testicle that this is what the author of that ""review"" had in mind when they were going with ""soulslike""."

ggl trnslt: 
Great review, MandaloreGaming! I would like to separately thank the people who translate your reviews into Russian. I myself can’t always understand some pieces of text, and thanks to them I looked through all your reviews (well, almost all, I haven’t played some games yet to watch reviews on them)"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Apparently the critics weren't entirely wrong, else difficulty settings wouldn't have been added. Obnoxious difficulty and mechanics are obnoxious regardless of whether or not that is the point, and a world and story as interesting and unique as Pathologics shouldn't be rendered out of reach to most players due to extreme difficulty. I for one believe Mandalore's views on the matter of difficulty are colored by the fact that he has built his channel on the backs of hard games with obtuse mechanics, so his veiws on whether or not the difficulty enhances or detracts from the experience should be measured with that in mind. What he considers difficult isnt what the average gamer considers difficult"

I don't have 3 hours to spare every evening rearranging all the trash and spare organs I picked up in the day in my stash."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,for a pretty miserable place it somehow have a lot of cute females
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game looks so fucking beautiful. It sounds like it is what I wanted from Vampyr, but you know, good. People shit talk the visuals but I think it looks fantastic from your video and GameRanx video.

By the way: Any recommends for games like this one?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,4:15 Caution: furry asserting dominance
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Pathologic 1 is vastly superior. In design, athmosphere, non restricted save system (what is perfect for a time limit focused game),  far better exploration (In Pathologic 2 they implemented casual and idiotic witcher senses, objectives marked on the map!, etc...), a true start without ultradecadent mandatory tutorial. I'm ok with permanent effects on saves, but to restrict saves to clocks is retarded and NO a hardcore survival mechanic at all but a counterintuitive silly one in a game so governed by time, daily task list, and heavy effects on your finalization rate (no choice and consequence, but try to beat the time: those are your tasks). The creepy Albino creature moment in Pathologic 1 now is a silly talk with a dumb muppet from childhood in a warehouse. The timing, the presentation, the story design kills the tension, interest and surprise. Pathologic 1 had (even more) repetitive mechanics and npcs, but the superb athmosphere and good story keeps the interest in ways that this remake don't even try. Pathologic 1 will continue to be a cult classic, while Pathologic 2 will be forgotten by most of the younger gamers of this decadent era. 

Still better game than 99% of nowadays games."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Finally you made review of this game. Btw is there any chance to see eng subs? English not my native language so im hard to understand it by listening

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I was gonna buy and play this then I found I have the first on in my steam library I think life want me to do the pain thing
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Don't trust this guy, he blew up a sbarro's in 2007, my 3 sons were killed in the explosion."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I really really want to get it . i love the surrealist surrounding it but fuck the mainstream reviews . it good game and i know it even before i play it . We used to follow the same and same unpolished mechanics in games and when we don't have them people cry.

If we don't go outside to look for it and ok for same and same thing . then that wrong form is . that why we get fallout 76 Anthem cod every year and even pokemon . we just want what we understand and not ready to seek what we never knew we want but we desperately need.


between semesters i will buy it full price . because game can be art for who appreciate it and have open eye."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"god i wish i liked games like this. i want to buy it and play it and love and support this beautiful metaphysical wonderland, but i know i'm too much of a shitter to actually enjoy it. i felt kinda bad for not buying the first game after seeing Mandy's review, but with this i feel _super_ bad, and i'm not referring to awkward high school seniors trying to get their dicks wet. maybe it's a cultural thing, i think MANd mentioned that in the last video, americans just aren't as interested in existential dread. ah well"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,You made me consider Pathologic but all my doubts disappeared with this one. I would have missed it if not for your reviews and I pretty much instantly bought it and completed the Haruspex route and enjoyed all of it. Thanks!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I cant play this game.
I would end up wasting a dozen hours piecing together by trial and error the perfect strategy for every single event the first time round."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Hell the game was working so awful on my pc so that I had to delete it and start saving for a new pc.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I would love to see you review Exanima. A fully physics based isometric RPG which one of the most unique and innovative combat systems to be made in over a decade. No damage values, no pre-rendered animations (except for the out-of-combat walk cycle), everything is handled by a built-from-scratch physics engine that calculates momentum, striking surface, armor being hit, etc. Every character has 1200 muscles being simulated every tick. The skill floor is high, taking a couple hours just to learn how to fight, even basically, but the skill ceiling is infinite. 


There are so many different tricks you can learn, from using your shield to shove people to the ground and stab them in the neck, to using the bottom of a halberd's ax head to hook behind an opponent's ankle and yank them off their feet. There's no actual dedicated combos or skill to learn to be able to do this, it's all based on mouse movement and momentum.  This is helped by the hitboxes, which are as accurate as can be. Every little gap in armor is an actual gap. If you hit between two plates of metal armor, where only cloth is protecting you, it will register as the cloth being hit. Not the metal.


It's still an early access game (yet also one of my all time favorite games, even though it's not complete) that's being slowly updated as the single programmer makes new systems from scratch in a way that hasn't been attempted before, but it deserves some publicity. It's still completely playable, with an arena mode that offers hundreds of hours of entertainment. Just from the combat. It's that good.


The story mode has 7 or so of the 12 planned levels in it, and it's a very cryptic, drip-fed style of lore that is delivered through notes and the environment. The closest equivalent I can think of for the way it's handled is dark souls. I also find the music to be fantastic. Honestly, I could gush on the game for hours talking about all of the minute details and physics that make the game as amazing and innovative as it is.


Please make a video on Exanima! It needs the attention and sales!"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,So happy you reviewed this game
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I just thought of a Platinum level achievement. Beat the game without digging through a single trash can.   It can be named something like ""I'm no hobo"""

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,You should play more new games. Like CDDA.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I'm coining a new term now which nobody will ever use: The Anderson-Syndrom: If you judge a game how you think it should be rather than let oneself in for the expierence and judge how well it is done. If your own bias prevents you from seeing stuff how it is.
For instance: If you think Skyrim is a walking simulator and rate it worse because it focused too much on combat, instead seeing it as Action-RPG.
Or If you think Starcraft is a base builder game and then complain about how fast it is and too much combat. The story don't even evolve around buiding! And what the heck is wrong with those mission without a base?!
Or if you think Soma isn't a horror game, because you are unable to feel tension, oblivoius to the atmosphere."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,can you do the fable series? fable 2 is only on xbox360 tho so idk if you can even play that.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Ofc people are hating the game, people are getting more and more conveniences when playing generic games to a point where if you don't follow the formula,your game is bad. Why? Because I can't play. Because I'm too lazy to commit into not being a crybaby. Hunger and thirst is boring,because I can't wander around and masturbate to characters wasting time. Fuck these people ."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Good game but its no the viod
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I recommend the Imperivm games for the list. It's an RTS saga made by Haemimont Games that as far as I know nobody outside of Spain remembers them. Probably nostalgia talking but I honestly think they are really good games.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""Junji Ito's Mongolian Thunderdome"" is the best phrase I've heard in a while."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game suffers from the same thing MMORPGs suffer from, and that's feeling like a chore. While it's not your tedious XP grind, you instead have to do all of this shitty decision-making while preventing the deaths of yourself and everyone else. You literally have to go out and get stuff to support yourself and babysit a dozen grown adults to make sure they're doing okay. It's not about difficulty more than it is just... Annoying, really.


It's real life if you lived in a third-world country that contained to worst citizens of Detroit and you had your bread laced with LSD."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Because of your previous review of Pathologic I immediately bough 2 when it released. I struggle really hard with games like this but the beauty and atmosphere pulled me through. An amazing experience.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I watched and enjoyed your suffering from the pathologic 1 review/critic 


it was glorious and strange, and honestly wonderful, I love seeing niche games, even if I dont end up playing them because the mechanics turn me off the game, sometimes I buy them just to show support, like dark forest, I have 2 minutes on steam, and it was worth it, maybe one day ill go play it. (the 2 min was on the menu) 


I watched this video once, or rather, listened to it, while smuggling drugs in starsector (ty seth), and didnt really pay much attention, I just watched it again, and Im glad I did, and this time I paid attention, I am currently installing it on gog, and ty for all the channels that mention it over steam, 30 day refund policy and no drm? sounds pretttttty good. anyways, Im downloading it, and will give it a whirl, gotta love the ""games journalists"" who literally think the only reason youd have something be challenging is because of dark souls. ninja gaiden says hello :D (not that I beat that game lol) 


anyways, ty for showing me the sequel, ty to the devs for making an interesting game and keeping their vision quite pure (I do appreciate the occasional map marker, unless the directions are quite good, and good hints)  and I love you :) ty Mandalore, you're great :)"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Faintly heard the Neverhood soundtrack and the Monkey Island one. Mad props. Knew I loved your work for a reason.
Also, glad you're back. Hope you're in good health. Missed your calm and collected take on games rarely covered by biased or genre-specific people.
Any chance you're planning on reviewing Masquerade Bloodlines 2 or Cyberpunk? In the meantime I'd like to hear your thoughts on some more story-centric games like Observation, Observer, Into The Wilds, or Darq.
I mostly go for anything long-ass RPG related, but those are far and few in-between and as I'm still running through Divinity Original Sin 2, I need something different to tide me over until Baldur's Gate 3 comes out."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Should have mentioned the fact that the game is so badly optimized that the recommended amount of ram is 16 gigs
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Holy fucking shit, those faces look great. All of the detail, their eyes and all of the micro-movements (eyes twitching a little, eyebrow movements influencing eyelids etc.). Work of art."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Sneaking WAS combat for me, i'm surprised you even got through the game without it even knowing the point of it. You could get past roaming enemies at night without wasting stamina to sprint away from combat, or if there were enemies who were alone you could sneak up behind them and take them out with just your fists, before they could even turn around. Sneaking was extremely useful and I didn't pick up a gun throughout my entire play-through because of it."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I've been convinced to pick this one up!

Lots of JoJo. Hell yes.
Also, gotta say, the models look good.
I'm not a fan of the chanting tracks, I like the atmospheric ones more for this game.
19:05 holy shit, that is hardcore.
I think the approach to guns is very interesting. It adds a sort of balance.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Weird russian games...great
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Pathologic makes some of the best use of unique features to video games as a form of media. This is exactly why it's not a walking simulator. A walking simulator is a book. It's all easily dictated to you for you to consume. In Pathologic you are forced to interact and decide and can be bad at the game. You're the lynch pin of this world you're interacting with. The story of a book exists without you. You're an observer. Pathologic is like if someone dictated a story to you and you tried to live it but there was room for choices and failure where things are not set in stone. I think the theater motif works perfectly. You're left to struggle and ad lib your way through a production. You can't simply read the book and enjoy it. That's not the point of it. Your own stress and failure as a player is part of the production itself. A book can't make you run in circles and squirm and try to find out what you're being told. I'm still not sure I adequately am conveying.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Wow your channel is growing, how wonderful. I don't pay close attention but I could have sworn it was half of what it is now last I checked"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I understand English, but it's really hard to translate so much information. So, is there a chance to get subtitles and when to expect them ?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Dude, you sold me on this, I really see the charm in this game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"8:06 ""ikiT cLan ALive in SKAvEnBLiGHT MaKE ALBum Of FasT RaT MaGic"" Does this have any deeper meaning?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Good to see you're doing better and no, you're not a bad salesman. Thanks to your review I bought Cultist Simulator and had a lot of fun with it. If you don't want to do Baldur's Gate II maybe try Tyranny? It's one RPG with interesting elements in it and a kinda messed up world."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,If Mandalore is a jojo fan now im going to cum
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Hey the Outer Wilds ship computer rumor mode is pretty similar to that mind map thing btw
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Mandalore I understand your spine was going several directions when writing this but I feel like you didn't really review the game to the best of your ability. You seem to show a bunch of interesting things in the game but you don't actually go into any of the themes or ideas it plays with. I feel upset that the game didn't really get the same treatment as say... Cybermancy. 


But thank you for the review. I hope all your chakras align and you are able to resurrect your spine."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I really enjoy your content and respect what you have to say. I was skeptical about Pathologic 2 after having seen your review on the first one, thinking it'd be to tedious and time consuming. I will buy this game solely because you recommend it."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Now I’m waiting for a Turgor review - even more bizarre and surrealistic game from Ice-Pick Lodge
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Dominions 5
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I liked the idea of the first but didnt have time to play a walking game. Dis looks about right. Gonna pick it up.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Can't understand people, who defend survival mechanics in this game. Feels like i come from work, turn on my pc, and then go to work again. at the end of the third day i accepted the fact, that i'm gonna die from hunger so i just tried to finish as much quests as i can, so when i came to talk to my childhood friends i just skipped most of the dialogue, because i was too preoccupied thinking where should i run next.
It is not an issue of mechanic being there, but of balancing. Does it really worth it to rob a house or dissect a corpse to become enemy of everyone in district, if all the money i get will recover me 1/4 of hunger at best?
Then again, back to the story integration, main character is not some random guy, many influential people tell him, that he is very important, but nobody helps him with healing items or food. Epidemic and hunger ar not an excuse, because at the same third day two odonghs commit a terrible crime by bringing you some organs for crafting. So what, they ready to die to teach you some basic mechanic, but can't spare some food? Nice!
Adding difficulty levels shows that devs cant ballance their own games, so they just gave you the tool to alleviate aspects that personally annoy you (and also made sure that you will feel bad for doing it)."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Awh, if only I had money to spare... I really loved EYE: Divine Cybermancy, and this is basically the second recommendation you've given for this game (kinda sorta)... hmmmmmmnnngh."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"If it has open world it is just another Skyrim, if it is also hard it is Dark Souls."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I was completely unprepared for your joke on Raid: Shadow Legends.

I was crying."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Whay is the next vid?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I know Baldurs Gate 2 is long, but it would be a shame to everyone who loves your videos if you skipped it. I am begging you to play it, i would LOVE to see a video."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"poor sales because reviewers want a fucking walking simulator?
have they still learned nothing?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Me at the intro: Ah this is a really nice spooky atmosphere he's got going -- god damnit.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,i mean... what..... a sequel.... for an obscure game no one but a few cult followers really know about and wasint that well received by critics.... i have to ask those crazy Russians....why?!! I'm sorry but the only time i would get more weirded out by an out of the blue sequel is half life 3 was finally announced.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Instant fucking like for the opening alone. 

Okay took a moment to bask in it. Now to enjoy the rest of the vid."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"So basically they made a sequel faithful to the original games’ concept, while improving the overall experience on every aspect.

Whether you like this game or not, it’s clearly a success"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,You're alive @_@
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,That picture of Aslan from your story off of PST XD
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"As a player that always go left first in front of a sign that says go right, I'm scared to play this game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Do you need to play Pathologic 1 to understand it? No... 
...Because good luck understanding it either way!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I absolutely love pathelogic 2 it's definitely become one of my favorites it's sad knowing it's not doing well review wise
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'm glad you're doing better! at least physically!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I always love the Gachi thats edited in
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"so glad I'm a producer.

keep up the good work Mandalore"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Gotta be honest, I generally re-watch these reviews simply for the fact that over the past 6 months because of what it does for my mental health, I developed anxiety to the point of ultimately having to be submitted to a partial hospitalization. This was due to a new job in the military and it broke me in a way that I'm still grappling with, but the way Mandalore reviews and his voice is able to bring me back to a more leveled state of mind instead of my brain feeling like its in a state of constant fight or flight."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Seems like an interesting game but too Avant-garde for me to actually play.  I would love to watch a chill person stream or LP it though.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,s h o t g u n c a n e
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Glad youre back!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,So I know you like mechwarrior and obscure rpg’s so i think you would enjoy a game called cogmind it’s a cheep rouge like that i honestly say is the poster child for the term hidden gem. You probably won’t see this but if you do just give it a quick glance
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,You're alive!!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,review some DUNE GAMES BRO
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I hope you cover Outer Wilds at some point
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Im buying this game soley based on this review. I hope the developers can celebrate their hardwork

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Dear MandaloreGaming,
 I love your videos for many reasons, like how informative they are, the amount of effort put into them. Thier style on itself is immersive for me and Pathologic 2 is also heavily immersive, so this combination of the two had my mind focused, yet... yet at 19:10 a large part of it started to party in childish, goofy madness and I did not understand what the hell happened, until I recognized what was the background music, Terry Scott Taylor - Klaymen's Theme from Neverhood. Thank you for the suprise flashback and keep up the wonderful work."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This motivated me to finally finish Changeling's route so I can play Pathologic 2 without feeling guilty. Hope they manage to finish Bachelor's and Changeling's route for 2, I'll be so sad if they don't"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,4:37 I see what they did there.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Always love the reviews!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Wow,thanks Mandalore,this is exacly my cup of tea !"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,is this review a jojo reference?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The other two characters will be added in for free.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Try 'The Void' from them. Unique game. Especially interesting that it has a different name in Russian with a more interesting meaning. In Russian, it's called Turgor. Which means ""the pressure is the force within the cell that pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall"". And it actually makes sense as a description of this game somehow, although the game doesn't have to do anything with biology or cells."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,legenda em inglês por favor
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Hi 😍
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I’ve not brought the game yet due to a dead PC and inability to get a replacement yet, but seeing the bad reviews has pushed me to buy up it when I have the money. 

Pathologic is meant to be difficult, because that helps mimic the panic of being in a potential plague and having to try to choose who needs your help the most, as well as who you need help the most. Making the game easier means you’re not going to feel that same pressure of choice, because you will probably have everything needed to help everyone. 

I hate the “games are art”, not because they’re wrong but because it’s only art to them if it’s their sort of art. If they cannot play it then it’s not art, even if the game in question is forcing players to ask where their priorities lie and who they consider to be worth helping, it’s only art if they can play it. And that’s limiting being belief. Games are not supposed to be for everyone; they are meant to have certain players in mind and not be watered down for the same of mass appeal."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Sees JoJo reference in the beginning, me:
""Ahhhh, a man of culture"""
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Thanks for putting me onto SulMatul, I didn’t know of him and his shit is so great, you’re doing the Lord’s work helping his channel out like that man"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,was that a mother fucking jojo reference?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The things some of these so called ""critics"" have been saying about this game proves once again why no one should listen to most of these morons who just want easy artsy 2 hour long indie games where they can easily see everything with zero mechanical skill or hard choices to make. This game is a massive step up from the first in my opinion and still one of the most unique gaming experiences one could ever try, anyone who gives it a pass because of the trash those ""critics"" publish is missing out something fierce."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Not my type of game and would probably be the most condensed 20 hours of misery I'd every experience playing a game. But it is an artistic masterpiece in that it hits every note the devs tried to, and it's a story worth telling."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I was on the fence about this game. Your review has convinced me to try it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It's quiet.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""I don't wanna watch it fade away and then in 5 years we're into some publication that gave it a bad review say that it was a hidden a gem and we all just missed it.""


Mandalore, you're a saint; I must say that I'm hating to see that today with: movies like Blade Runner and Star Wars Ep 1 to 3, games like the first Pathologic, Call of Cthulhu, Turok, System Shock, Space Marine, Hellgate London, Anachronox, Gothic series, point and click adventures, and they're starting to do that hypocrisy now with Doom 3."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Is that a mf'in JOJO REFERENCE??????!!!!!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Im hype been waiting for my monotone monster
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Hah, I was listening to the soundtrack and thought to myself, ""Damn, that sounds just like 'Theodor Bastard'.""  It was.  I remember first hearing them well over a decade ago when a couple of videos came out on Newgrounds (back when that was a thing) called 'Pustota' and 'Selva'.  Check it out on youtube, you might like it.  I think I bought an album of theirs, but I don't remember.  Anyway, their music suits the game well."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Time to look for hidden Lowrys
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,4:14 That furry is asserting his dominance. I feel scared.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The fucking terrifying Aslan costume holy shit
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I think im am going to by it. I played the first and was realy impressed 10 years ago. This looks like a good update to playability.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Jesus fuck that Aslan is much more terrifying than I thought
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This looks bomb I'm getting it
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"For some reason, I had it in my mind that this went Epic exclusive, and I was heartbroken. I'm relieved it isn't, and I'll pick this up really fuckin' soon.

Great content as always, m'lord."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,it is both a remake and a sequel... MorUtopion: You Can (Not) Replay
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Do you know a game called 'A Place for the Unwilling' by any chance? 

It has kinda same vain as Pathologic, open world, clock always ticking, wierd town, it's a newly released game, made by french developers and received very little attention, I comment in here in hope you may be able to help it as well. :p

PS - there is also an upcoming play in town, 'The King in Yellow'"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Having enjoyed a few LP's of the first game (despite the walking) I believe you've convinced me.  I've just bought the Support Bundle.  I would LOVE to see the other characters.  Also, this will be my first time jumping into this bovine obsessed town.  Cheers."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I fucking love this account and it’s content
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The arts and design reminds me of the animation 9 and some samurai jack.
PreTTY nice indeed."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""Kids are dumb.""
While I disagree with this statement in general, I'd like to focus on it in the context of the game: kids, just like anyone else will trade stuff based on their perception of their appropriate value. And this value will be formed no only by the usefulness of these items, but also things like belief system and even personal preferences. There was a great example in the Marble Nest: kids have a believe that pertains to the connection between nuts and souls and, as such, will be happy to trade to the adult mundane but useful things like bandages in exchange with something of equal or greater value in their eyes.
Or, as an example from the first part: you could exchange different jewellery with girls and while it's a good trade for you to give them low-tier items like the copper rings, it might be more profitably for you to trade in the gold with the adult trader, since little girls' perception of golden rings' value a that of an adult would be quite different. And little boys aren't even interested in any of this - now, knives and blades are quite different affair for them.
Just like any economic transaction, the value is completely up to both sides of the transaction. Just like in, say, X series you can sell some materials for far better profit at some stations as opposed to, say, the station that produce said materials. It's just that price of these goods are formed far less by mystical believes of the suffering populace and far more by global economic processes merely because of the setting."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Really interesting I think I'll pick up this game, Tried Pathologic 1 and it was very difficult to get into.
Also get well soon Mandalore I've suffered with a back injury and I highly recommend swimming and yoga rather than prescription medicine. I really recommend it from my experience at a pain management unit."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Pathologic 2 Gameplay videos? :P
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The best part of Pathologic 2 is that it's a game I can play. Though someone calling it ""Budget Skyrim"" is truly an astounding, bizarre conclusion to come to. Also Soulsian=difficulty train needs to stop."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,<3
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'm afraid the bad sales might mean we won't get the bachelor and changeling...this is exactly why I hoped they released it all together rather than in parts

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"These guns at 6:51 seem to be based on the ""Karl Gerät"" from ww2 germany. The gun looks almost identical, but the real machine was mounted on tracks, not on railcarts. In case anyone wanted to know lol"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Sorry to ask but does anyone know what music is playing as the list of benefactors rolls?

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Glad to hear you are well again. Great video as always.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I never got into the first game, for various reasons. But this actually looks like something I'd like to try."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Please continue to make content it’s all amazing and I always get a boost of good mood juice when I see an upload from you. Thank you for the hours of entertaining, engaging, humorous but also informative videos. I’ve found a ton of games that I now love because of you and I wouldn’t have without you."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"you putting a total war: Warhammer reference in this video is giving me blue balls, amazing video as always."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Did you hear about Russian Roulette 2: The Next Worlds. https://youtu.be/ydh02DJZzKE Its like a proto GTA. The first world is very atmospheric. I think you might enjoy it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Happy to support such an interesting concept and someones personal vision

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"21:23 wait, was that Necrovision??????"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Awaken MY MASTA!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I'll probably pick this up next time I get money in. I had never heard of the Pathologic games until you did your reviews but the first game looked much less fun. This one looks pretty damn good. I agree with your defence on the difficulty, I like difficult games for the challenge but also what actions it makes you do that you wouldn't otherwise, a lot of games make enemies more bullet spongy and call that difficult which although it is it just makes things tedious.

Great review as always, I look forward to the next and hope you heal up soon!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Did somebody say RAID: Shadow Legends? The detail on those champions is amazing.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Ikit Claw is greatest skaven YES-YES
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,i think it's the 1st time i replay an intro because it was so good xD
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'll buy this thanks to this review. The devs worked hard and they deserve this!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,when my pc arrives ill probably get this game
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Oh Dear Aslan, there's furries? Did you ask him if he knows Shammy?"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"That mind map is one of the most incredible bits of game UI I've ever seen. I would love for more games to come up with similar ideas to guide the player in such an engaging way. Also, I notice in the video that looting a cabinet actually hides items in the grid behind drawers that you have to choose to open. That is such a small think, but I love that attention to detail."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Its quiet
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Sold on pathologic and your channel, well done!"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I understand your point on baldurs gate 2 but it would still be one of my life's highlights to hear your voice talk about it and watch a quality video on it for .. I don't know, maybe one to four hours! If I ever get rich I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Outstanding review, really great stuff. Thanks for making it!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,24:55 this pisses me off so much when I see it happen.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I was all for watching this, but this is the first time in my life that I've actually stopped (2 min. in) a video and decided that I wanted to play a game and experience it for myself. I want my first time in Pathologic 2 to be completely blind."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Good to hear you're well and back

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,ayy cyka
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Games journos really need to stop comparing games to other games all the time. Not every open world is Skyrim, not every difficult game is fucking Dark Souls. I get making comparisons so viewers can get an idea but dear fucking god use some new lines!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It's quiet
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Why gaming journalists are always so narrow minded?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Best slavgames reviewer.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game looks really interesting, especially the world building and art direction. And it looks like an improvement over Pathologic 1 as well. I hope this sequel does well, the creators deserve it."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The dialogue screens with the faces are impressively beautiful.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"26:22 i know i game i didnt like on the first playthrough. it was dark souls 2. i kept playing though and started to question myself. in the middle of the 4th playthrough i started so many things i was doing terrible or even straight up ignoring. so i changed my approach and the entire game opened up for me, and now i have more playtime in DS2 than any of the other souls games (including demon's and bloodborne).
run fighting never stops being amusing."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,A whole section dedicated to music and sounds? Is this raycevick in disguise?

Better watch out! Some journalist might call you an elitist gatekeeper for liking it!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"So glad I caught that podcast and understand the hilarity behind the play picture and how terrifying Aslan actually is

god damnit I feel like there's even more hidden lore in mandalore"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Great review, and glad your doing okay. Also just wanted to say that imo a game about surviving in a chaotic and dangerous plague ridden scenario being difficult should really only add to its artistic integrity. I might have to check this one out."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'm glad you bought the bull.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Now you must review The Void, same developer team. Pretty please?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Fucking FINALLY a review that actually gets the point.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,My god I've missed you lad
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Im pretty sure the correct name is Hobo economy 2: Electric boogaloo
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Sounds like the music was done by Danheim, which is 100% fine."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The Cult of Karl, the 600mm mortar and Its leader, Schwerer Gustav, the fucking train artillery."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I love the style of pathologic. Happy there is a more modern remake. Saddens me that publications always want easy modes though. Fellas if you can't get through a game, that's not to the games detriment, it's you. These people seem terrified of self improvement and it's baffling. Look at someone like Yahtzee, the dude loves difficult games, kinda shows us that most ""game"" journalists are more journalists than gamers."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,2:53 oh shit
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Truly one of the greatest games I have ever played. Its major themes are theater, death, and meat. 10/10, I hate-love it so much."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Just bought the supporter's bundle on Steam :) I think the game still has the chance to make money, but it needs to be picked up by big Youtubers, and god help me, perhaps even streamers (this game is really not meant for streaming). I think somebody like Pewds can make almost any game into best seller... since the quality is really good, there is still hope."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Do a review on Movie battles 2!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,EEEE suka.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I have been waiting for this. Good stuff, that game looks awesome and we need more games like this. Hard is good, thats the way to go."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Mandalore - please do a video on Morrowind. I think it totally gets slept on in the shadows of Oblivion and Skyrim, and I think you would do it justice to show its beauty and deep flaws at the same time."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,WELL FUCK TIME TO BUY ANOTHER AMAZING GAME THAT WONT RUN WELL ON MY PC
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Oh my god they have *GRU FROM DESPICABLE ME* IN THEIR GAME!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,So this game have an Path and logic going for it ... hmmm hhmmm:D
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Got me with that ""Э, сука!"". I'm dying, thank you so much."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Does anyone know the reason behind his channel name?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,MandaloreGaming: The only review you should care about
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It's quiet.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,19:20 what game is that?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"But, you already did a Morrowind video. 

You wouldn't remember, though."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,GOG is the best
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Lowry is making his rounds again I see.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"MandaloreGaming (13:22):  ""... Urgh, my head... Is someone shilling RAID: Shadow Legends near me...?""

Holy Shit. Should we call a fire department for that sick burn? X'D"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Glad you're back!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"At the end of the day, game like this will never be a great seller. The crowd it appeals to is niche. 
It really sucks but i'm sorry, them's the breaks."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Im so thankful Mandalore for this review as i was starting to be scared that this game will not spread to more people. It does have a lasting effect on me and even after i finished it completely, i still just want to play it and look around the town and its inhabitants.
Tbh i knew you would review this game (you are the one that forced me to buy this awesome game after your review of the first game) but i was kinda scared that you will review it after another 2 chars will be released and that would be too late as i would suspect and would not see that this game is finished right now and those new characters will only be something like a free story expansion.
So thank you from all of my heart Mandalore."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Fantastic review as always. It does make me smile that there are hundreds of Steam reviews of this game that land along the lines of ""This game makes me want to kill myself,"" and ""This is the most depressing experience I've ever had,"" that all, of course, highly recommend the title.
I look forward to whatever you delve into next time. Not getting a teaser this go-round has me curious."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,heeey cykaa
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Game Journalists: ""You can't critique the game, its a form of art."" (for SJW nonsense titles)


also Game Journalists: ""This game is too hard and/or too cryptic it needs an easy mode!"" (for actual original well thought out and put together titles)"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Stronghold music in the background :)
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game's Style reminds me a lot of Zeno Clash.
That one too had a very strange world & culture, but a way more straight-forward story."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,THE SPICE WILL FLOW
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Neverhood music! :D
Now that makes me nostalgic. I grew up with that game and now I kinda miss it. xD"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,i never clicked so fast in my life
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I was wondering if something happened to you, glad to hear you're doing better."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Is that a jojo reference.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,music is very wichery
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Awaken, awaken my weird children!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Mindmap reminds me of the Sherlock Holmes games. Haven't played them in a long time though so don't remember how different it is
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,AYAYAYAY
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The executors look so boss
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Seems like Mandy became a JoJo fan since the last video
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"your Pathologic video is probably my favourite of yours, so glad to see a continuation!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Loved the neverhood ost in the background.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Game journalists are the pretty shit both on the games and journalism front. You are pretty much the real deal in comparison.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,So this new review is a remake of the old one or a sequel?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"ЭЭЭ, СУКА"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Great review! Sad to hear its may not be selling well, the industry needs these kind of games more than ever, challenge genres and shack things up. I will be keeping an eye out for it as I never heard of the series until you covered it on your channel, at the very least grab it on sale. Genuinely offering something different and reminds me of Call of Chtulu ;]"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I wish Journalists would understand that a hard game difficulty should be respected as an artistic decision. In the same way a movie is created to be violent or have certain themes to it. Hard games are just an aspect of the creator's direction for the game itself. If every game needs to have a spoofed baby mode, then you lose the core value the game has."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Do a video on New Vegas, it is one of my favorite game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I have a solution for people who can't play this game because it's hard. 


Just use cheat engine lol. Or some trainer (but try to find cheat engine table). The game will become just walking and chatting for you. 


- ""BUT IT'S CHEATING!11""
- I'm not the one crying like a lil child about the difficulty or game mechanics."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Warning GOG does not have the refund policy he is talking about! The refund only happens if you are found to be unable to to run the game within 30 days! It is not a I-don't-like-it-therefore-refund-me-policy
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,">Neverhood OST
Ah, I see you're a man of impeccable culture as well."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,18 seconds in and I'm sold on this game
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,*It's quiet.*
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,JoJo lol
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Very good review Mandalore, I don't think this game is my cup of tea but you explained it very well and made it sound interesting."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Only the intro was worth the wait.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I really want to watch this damn video, but after watching the review on the first game I'm really thinking of buying it because of you. I guess I'll leave it for later :s"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Two month been waiting. Enjoying yourself playing this game aren't you.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The goddam pillarman
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Hey mandalore. Is the specific events that rely on the other characters in 1 still in 2 or are they cut?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Starts with a jojoke. Instant like

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"arnt point and click walkthrough adventure game fans just a bunch of 50+ old housewives? 
Yeah, no wonder this game flopped given 90% of the people likely to buy it. XD"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Nah please do morrowind, dont hurt me like this ive been waiting"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"20:00 And Neverhood music plays in background. Great.
Oh and then Stronghold theme"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Just watching this it came to me that RainWorld was made for a review from you. It's so incredibly idiosynchratic but also cute and weirdly unapproachable. It's great, one of my all time faves. Noone ever talks about it even tho it's a masterpiece in it's own right"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Praise the emperor. He still lives!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I’d probably hate this game, but it’s what a game should be. 

I’ve never been very good at games, be it mechanically or tactically, so I don’t know if I could even beat this one, I usually play games that are easy and let me blow things up so I can unwind after work. 

But I would never go out and say a game like this is bad. Saying the game isn’t for you is one thing but at the same time alongside things like dark souls, you’ve gotta admit that it’s your own failings preventing you from enjoying it. This game is a crazy work of art, it shouldn’t be getting bad reviews for being difficult. That’s bullshit 

Ima buy it. Pray for me."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,MUG!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,19:35 Outer Wilds did a great job with that kind of system. It's called 'rumor mode/map' there.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I am disappointed...
The music at the start brought promises of naked oiled Custodes."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"wait i though only mushroomer was doing music, but they've actually invited theodor bastard? that fits good. not on par with 1 but"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I did nit know about this game until now, if I had more money and time I most likely would buy it today. But I have to wait a month to save money ( I'm  a poor student), but I will own this one at some  point"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Slavic specialty dish formula is remarkably accurate.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Have you considered that maybe the clones are the result of intentional design? I mean they probably aren't, but who knows"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The game looks dope!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,So it turns out video game journalists are a complete failure and a joke... and no one was surprised.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""Is someone shilling Raid Shadow Legends near me?"" When is someone NOT shilling Raid Shadow Legends near you?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"REALLY enjoy, our Channel."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"That pillar men intro made my day!
Goddam :D"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"well, glad you're better.
dont push yourself tho.




on a side note if you want a good game recomendation i'd recomend underrail, recently got an expansion and seem to be right up your alley"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"11:50 Thank you, gamer."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The mind map looks fairly familiar to outer wilds take on learning the story and I DEFINITELY recommend everyone play it
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"One thing friends, GOG sure does have a refund policy but they dont do it automatically, first. and second, there is a limit on how many times you can refund games. I asked their techsupport for a refund of anno 1404 after some other refund and their answer was 'but this is the last time'. It actually turned me off gog. I still play the games i have there but im not buying anything there to try new stuff except if im 100% sure ill play it. I guess gog doesnt like money."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I absolutely love your videos and your voice.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Does anyone know where the scream from 1:10 comes from ? I've seen mandalore use it in a few of his videos.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Reminds me alot of Planescape: Torment.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,waking up to a Mandalore video is like waking up with fresh Pizza next to me

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Welcome back to the steppe lands; filled with mystic plague and bizarre cultish joy of going down the rabbit hole of a deranged Russian's mind. It's still a fun rabbit hole.


It also goes to show that not everyone is either ready or willing to sacrifice."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Hmm i think the music for Pathologic 1 was better, the weirdness of the half life-native mix really sold to alien nature of the world"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Mandalore! 11:44 Thug have say ""Эй, сюда!"" - ""Hey, here!"". No cyka this time, but furry-boys before Polyhedron brige can meet you with... ВОТ И УЁБЫВАЙ ОТСЮДА!"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"wasnt expecting Jojo, but its fine."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Not suka. Suda = come here.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The animations need interpolation between keyframes, and a few more things need to be polished. Currently this game is a flawed gem."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Oh please please please make a Baldur's gate 2 review!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Mandalore, if you like the mind map and the kind of gameplay that lends itself to it, I cannot recommend The Outer Wilds enough. It's really incredible, and it's almost impossible to talk about without spoiling."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,fast rat magic
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,What is that at 8:06
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,must resist urge to build spice mine
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Mr. Mandalore ! We‘ve been expecting you ... 😏
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Hello! Want to recommend very interesting series of games: A. I. M. (Artificial intelligence Machines) aka Механоиды. And one quote about this game:
“Mechanoids 2” (A. I. M. 2: Clan Wars) can be considered the pioneers of the cyber-hippi genre on our computers: under the blue sky, over the green meadows, intelligent machines are unhurriedly fighting for universal unity of mind. I'd like to make these cars happy."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Journalists: Games are art

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I’ve been waiting for this.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"thank you for taking the time to critique the past, present, and future of the PC gaming as an art form. It's wonky at times but all art is at some point."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I literally bought alpha centauri because of your review on it, and I might get this one too. You certainly put a lot of work into your videos. They always feel worth the wait. Keep of the great job!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Been watching Jojo lately Huh?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Heeeeey! Mandalore is alive!

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"coming from someone who spends at least 5 hours a day on youtube you videos are no joke, the best, most interesting and most entertaining videos I have ever watched."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Hey Mandalore maybe you could do a review for updated version of No mans sky?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"8:07 ""Ikit Claw alive in Skavenblight. Make album of fast rat magic"" could you please explain this Mandalore, also, should we expect warhammer references in every video until December? (I still remember the Durthu reference in the Lord of the Rings game video)"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"A weird town full of furries and freaks. Dont tell shammy.





Side note, any one who said ""games are a work of art and art shouldn't be critize"" should drink bleach. The art of games is the entertainment of playing it."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This and Silent Hill 3 are the only two games that gave me the feeling as if I've survived pure hell.What a fantastic game.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I love the way he says""Get over hereeeee. . ."" at 11:10. I can't remember Mandalore emoting so much"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,11:28 what is this Warhammer game?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,the second game i buy because of you...you costing me money bro... idk how to feel about that...
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,IS THAT A MOTHER FUCKING JOJOS REFERENCE
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"of course game journalists want the game to be a walking sim, they don't want to do something that requires any effort."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"New vegas is making a mild resurgence on youtube, i've been seeing way more new vegas lps and stuff, right now might be the right time to make a video on new vegas, new vegas"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"When I was a kid and didn't know how the industry operates, I used to ask why they don't remake all the good games every few years with better graphics. Ice-Pick Lodge doesn't seem to know the answer either.

It just made these past 14 years worth living"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Genre: Russian
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Ah, shit! Here we go again."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,nice
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Man the rush of excitement I get when I see one of your videos posted was a feeling I had missed! Hope your recovery is going well.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"It was 7:30 AM when I opened the video.
First 20 seconds. Few moments. Suddenly... 
AYAYAYAYAYAYYYYY...! Mandalore is truly a man of culture."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Finally, someone with the correct opinion on Pathologic 2."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Welp, here I go buyin' a game!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Well, quite frankly, the ""games are art"" folks tend to be pretentious narcissistic pieces of shit. I love art, but I hate the art world because 99% of the people involved are there to gain social status through pretense rather than actually having some sort of appreciation of real artistry and beauty. Soulless pieces of shit, that's what the vast majority of art-people are."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I regret watching this on acid
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Now I really want to get this
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"11:40

There was no ""suka"" there. That was a really lazy ""siuda"". He said ""Hey, come here""."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Yo, did the guy who wrote the headline comparing this to Skyrim ever fucking play EITHER game? The amount these two games share is probably so small and consists of such superficial nonsense such as ""it's a game"" and ""there is an inventory"" that to compare them at all is absurd. Like, I'm floored."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Did you think you could sneak passed that NeverHood theme and get away with it?                                                                       
Too late, you have to review the Neverhood now, along with Skullmonkeys"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It’s not a Mandalore review without a Russian game in it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Nikolay Dybowski - the founder of Ice Pick Lodge - was giving a speech at one small game developers event at Tomsk some time after the release of Pathologic 2. In his words that was quite a hard thing to push through release. They went into the whole remaster thing thinking that they will just pump up graphics a bit and figure proper English release, but it all got so much more complicated down the way... And after release it barely covered itself. At the closing of his speech he said that they would probably never do games in that way any more. I'm not sure if it covers other characters from original game, that were supposed to be released later...


Honestly, that's all a real shame. As someone from Russia, I can count proper Russian game developing studios by the fingers on my one hand and with a few to spare. And among those, Ice Pick Lodge was really doing games as an art. And seeing how they are having troubles just because they are not pushing another fortnite riddled with lootboxes... it's heartbreaking, really. And yeah, I can totally see a point in Dybowski's words - he actually needs to pay people, so they can eat. And it's Russia, so it's not like they are on some EA-bullshit-levels of payroll. 


So yeah, guys, from the bottom of my heart - go try this game out. It's deep, beautiful theatrical experience with some amazing story. Try it out on GOG, on Steam, return it if it's not your thing, but give it a chance. It's one of the best games I've ever played. It's not perfect by any means, but it's just gorgeous in it's storytelling and atmosphere."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25 THE LOWRY POSE!!!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The mindmap idea is in Outer Wilds. It's a great idea!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,1:25 Death has come for us
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I kind of get where the reviewers are coming from, as Pathologic 2 is at its core a difficult art game, and art games (wikipedia calls Pathologic 2 an adventure game, but they are most similar to walking simulators and all under the umbrella of the title art games) are never made with a strong gameplay focus, even if it does enhance the story here. Even with the more difficult survival elements, you are still walking around, talking to people, and having inventory challenges. So that gameplay really isn't enhanced by this extra difficulty, but is more of a hindrance to what is the gameplay part of this kind of game. Calling it dark-soulsesque and a budget Skyrim don't really make any sense, but I think that underlying discomfort with this game is justified as it doesn't fit well with this genre of game. I'm not here to defend those reviewers, I'm saying the developers didn't really understand how to improve its game in this genre. Survival is more of an aesthetic than genre, able to be applied to basically anything, and the developers probably thought it would be a good way to spice up the game and have it work in their crafted world. And they did a good job there, with it being so embedded that trying to avoid it seems like trying to step away from the immersion as a whole, as Mandalore brings up. But these survival elements only get in the way of the adventure game interactions of strong story and setting, dialogue, and item use. You spend more time concerned with keeping yourself going as opposed to being able to talk to more people and have more items available for use and actually be playing the game. Pathologic 1's challenge worked better in the genre because instead of getting in the way of those mechanics, it strained them with all the walking and being obtuse. All the walking at least never takes away something from the player in game. It made the game boring, but that is basically what happens when you try to make an adventure game difficult."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I am literally 10 seconds into the video, and I already feel my brain stretching painfully to the kind of content this game offers, AND I LOVE IT."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,When your Review of the game is so good that the devs contacted you on release to review their Next game....NOICE.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"so then playing the first won't matter... :/ ....now i will only play half the franchise... that easy, to loose half fan base..."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,On my birthday nice
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"That ""Mind Map"" system for keeping track of quests and information sounds legitimately innovative for an RPG/story-based game.  I hope that is something that is pursued in other games in the future."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Не эй СУКА, а эй СЮДА"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I've been looking forward to this review since finishing the game and I'm glad it's finally out. It's also a really fair review and sums up my feelings about this game pretty well.
When I played the game (roughly three weeks after release) some of the technical problems were still there, but less severe than you described. I'd only get those drastic framedrops when entering a building and when I opened any menu, map etc. for the first time after starting the game. There were some t-poses, but thats about it. No hard crashes or noteworthy bugs.


I really liked the graphics and think that the game looks stellar. It's no AAA-""photorealistic"" game, but it doesn't want to be either. It looked incredibly good and atmospheric, and proves once again that good lighting and art direction are far more important than high texture resolution and polygon count. And speaking of art direction, that was also fantastic. It has such a unique, confident and consistent style, it's absolutely admirable. I even bought the digital artbook because I like those visuals so much (and also to support the developer a bit). 
The mythology and lore of this world is also incredibly well done. It feels really authentic and fleshed out. Somehow this weird merge between bull-worshipping steppe culture and early industrial western culture just works so well and I didn't have to suspend my disbelief once. When I suddenly found myself deep in the literal belly of the town and saw it's beating heart I was not taken out of the game. The world and it's inner workings are so well established and believable.


I found the soundtrack by itself to be less catchy and memorable. I can still hear a lot of the individual tracks from P1 in my mind. And the main menu track is forever engraved into my brain and will propably be the last thing I remember after late-stage dementia has completely decayed my mind. But those tracks stood out from the game, they were great but they didn't neccessarily contribute much to the atmosphere and narrative of the game. Pathologic 2's music is much more in harmony with the game itself, it helps build the atmosphere and mood of certain events and places. In that regard I would consider it to be the better soundtrack.


The mind-map is truly genius and if this game has only one influence on the world of gaming, it should be this. I always knew what to do, where to go and why I had to do something, without the game holding my hand or me having to follow the dreaded dotted line on the minimap. It's the perfect marriage between quest log, journal and quest marker. 


The different survival mechanics are really great and engaging. They added a lot of organic difficulty and made the game truly tense and stressful at times. A certain reviewer called them dismissively ""meter management"" and while that is true to some extent, I found it to be really, well, engaging and it added a lot of interactivity and stuff to do to the game. Preventing yourself from dying or considering to just starve a little bit so you can still finish one certain quest before time runs out added a completely new layer of fun to the game. 
The economy, resource management and resource aquiring was also really great. It was way more complex compared to P1. At times I really struggled to get certain items and it really felt like a town in crisis where food and medication is scarce. In P1 it was fairly easy for me to get enough money/resources and I was never truly at risk of dying from starvation or exhaustion. 


And it truly felt like a race against time and an enemy that will always be stronger. I really struggled to achieve all my goals, save as many people as possible and not die in the process. You have to weigh out which quests and people you prioritise as you can't save everyone and you can't follow all leads (at least I couldn't, I guess some madman would be able to). 
I felt that my decisions truly have consequences. One character may die because I preferred to save a different one or because I had to spend my time scavenging trash cans for valuable items to trade for food. And by this some quest line would be blocked off or not be available in the first place. The game had me really consider my priorities and options unlike any other game I know. Do I search through trash cans and lose valuable time or do I kill some guys and loot their corpses? It would save me some much needed time, but seriously hurt my reputation which could lead to me getting attacked more or being unable to trade in certain districts. Do I run through an infected district to save some time but risk infection, or do I walk around? Stuff like this. There's a trade-off in every single decision. And there's of course the punishment-for-death system, which I really grew to love.
I think the only misstep is the abbatoir, which is visually and atmospherically absolutely stellar, but the forced combat made it quite frustrating. 


In short, I really, really love this game. All those different mechanics were incredibly engaging and I wasn't bored for even a single moment. I was really immersed and invested into the game and it's world, I really cared about the town and it's weird inhabitants. Tense, stressful, hopeless, yet I'm still looking forward to playing the game again soon. And I'm anxiously awaiting the other two characters. It's one of the best experiences I've had in a video game over the past few years and I hope that some people take your recommendation to heart. It's such a unique and weird experience, unlike anything I've ever experienced before. This game is truly original, it doesn't try to emulate or recreate any different work. It really is art and I share your frustration with certain parts of the gaming community who dismiss this game and favor walking sims as an example of games as art (I do love walking sims though)."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Hey i told you about this in your first one
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Woah Mandalore you doing pathologic 2 already? now you need to review The Void by Ice Pick Lodge too!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Game journalists wouldn't know a gem if it landed on their laps.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I was here first Greg screw you
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I really hope that your intervention manages to give this game the turnaround for you. I can't bring myself to dive into another experience like this when I've already sunk so much time into games lately, but I do hope it succeeds."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I was starting to worry about where you've been, sir Mandalore, but i guess this video completely answers that question."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"It's good to have you back Mandalore. I saw that Pathologic 2 had come out, thought that was interesting, then moved on. Not even 10 minutes into this video you sold me on it. Thank you for the awesome videos"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Your wonderful reviews are just right man.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I know New Vegas is not as obscure as some of the other games you review, but I would definitely be interested in your opinions!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Happy to have you back Sir Mandalore, ""cyka blyat"" as they say in the old country."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Curious as to if you're excited for Stalker 2?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I'll pick this up eventually (probably soon) because ""The Void"" is one of my all time favorite games, and I was very interested in Pathological 1, but just couldn't force myself to play through it. I will say I'm not a big fan of meter management in games for the most part though.I disagree with your case for it somewhat too. 

I fully understand the immunity bar, but why do I have to have a hunger bar?  In most games the bar drains so quickly that your character is on a 20,000 calorie diet every day. I don't know about you but I can't eat seven hot dogs, twelve pineapples, a trough of cotton candy, and an entire wheel of cheese in one day. It's usually poorly implemented since it's so hyper sped up to make it gamey. Kind of like how I have some tools my great grandfather had when he was in his 20s-30s. How can a 80 year old wood handled shovel be perfectly fine, not a speck of rust and original handle, but my in game pick breaks after two swings? I've got some 15 year old clothing too that I actively wear that I haven't had to fix too. Taking out the bar wouldn't make it a ""walking sim"" like you say. Master Chief doesn't have to break out some MREs between levels and I don't see people saying Halo is a walking sim. Phoenix Write doesn't have a mid court hearing sandwich... etc.


I think just being the detective and piecing together the story while doing medical things is fine. No need to add in being a cook and seamstress.

I wouldn't mind a few meters to manage, but at a certain point it's tedious and I just remember all the IRL meters I should be managing instead. Should I sit here and manage a fictional man's hunger, thirst, and the sweat percentage of his left sock? Or should I make my IRL yard work meter go down?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Bring the Noise
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I greatly appreciate that the games method of changing the difficulty is to give the player a thousand sliders to customise it. I'm not really a big fan of those set difficulties you see in most games because 90% of the time it's one element of the game that bothers me and makes it frustrating, not the wide range of things that usually get changed between difficulty settings.


For example, Skyrim. On the higher difficulties, any enemy that has the ability to do those insta-kill animations on you can do them when you're at full health. This is annoying as fuck because you get cheap-shot by enemies all the time, and so you need to cheese them to not get killed. But if you play on the lower difficulties, then *you* one shot everything. If it were possible to play around with the exact difficulty settings, you could fix it so that you wouldn't one shot or get one shot."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"When everyone compares Mandalore to Tzeentach but you feel that Mandalore's quality and consistency is much better. As well as his jokes. Honestly, Tzeentach is ok, but a bit too edgy for me. I can binge Mandy whenever. Not Tzeentach, I have to be in the mood for him."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Wait.... SSeth is Mandalore.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I see the reaction to this game as video game criticism itself going through some growing pains. Film criticism is split pretty well in half between the ""Arty"" films and the ""popcorn"" flicks. We all understand the distinction and know where to get our reviews from. You know which reviewers focus on disposable trash and which ones focus on impenetrable nonsense.

Video games sort of have this, but the thing is video games can be difficult in multiple ways: either difficult to play, or difficult to understand. 

A video game like dear Esther is, imo, difficult in precisely the same way as holy motors. It's hard to understand what's going on and what it's trying to say. By contrast, cup head is just fuckin hard to play. The plot takes zero brain cells to understand, but the gameplay is taxing.

Pathologic is both, and I think that's why it's getting a critical paddling. It appeals neither to the cuphead or Esther crowds. It is a difficult game mechanically and its hard to understand.

I also think most of game ""reviews"" are just buyers guides, and that definitely isn't helping. This game appeals to very specific individuals, and players that just want to turn their brain off and have fun are gonna hate this."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"On the topic of the mind map, Outer Wilds (not The Outer Worlds, that's the Obsidian one coming up) does the same thing, and is also an absolute masterpiece of a game IMO."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,So glad to see you back in action! Welcome Back Mandalore!

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I really want this game now
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,A video on Quake 4 would be nice.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Wait i got unsubbed... When? Freaking youtube
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,do a playthrough.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,“THE LIST” seems pretty long but if you are adding to it then Caves of Qud seems right for you.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The music does have a direct parallel, Nier: Automata."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Wierd game but interesting.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Typical v i d e o g a m e urinalists trashing a game that doesn't hold their hand all the way like Skyrim. Go figure! I'm glad you at least gave it a fair shot.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"finally, someone shouts out sul."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The game goes past ""cryptic"" or ""intriguing"", right into ""pretentious"" and ""annoying"". The developers even admitted on the steam forums, that they literally don't want you to have fun playing. The difficulty is just unfair, the dialogue is made unnecessarily complicated and weird and you are just constantly sprinting from quest to quest. 

All in all - the devs succeeded - it was not fun to play it in any way, shape or form. And not, it's not ""challenging"" - your character having to scarf down food constantly or literally die of hunger on the spot is just a way to keep you from actually exploring and enjoying the world. Also it's optimized like shit."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Yay, Mandalore's alive :) great video bud, bought myself a copy of the game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Cool video SSeth
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Who Knew Mandalore would start with Jojo
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Frick im late to the video
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Glad to see youre back! hope you get better everyday :)
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Love your work, as always."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,ah yes the stronghold music at the end
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I really hope that ice pick lodge will still continue with making the other character paths available. It's kinda sad because I guess that games like pathologic aren't games that would ever be liked by the mainstream crowd. Hell, it's not even understood by game critics if the complaining about the survival meter is any indication. That's what I love most about pathologic. The story and gameplay are in perfect alignment. You're in a town ravaged by plague, of course surviving is going to be difficult. The game also forces you into some really uncomfortable situations without it being obvious. Are you going to run around in an infected district trying to save important characters from getting sick or do you find that you do not have enough boosters for everyone including yourself. Who are you going to save in that situation? Lastly I love that they gave Artemiy childhood friends. I really wanted his friends to survive until the end of the game and I did some pretty desperate things to make that happen. It was worth it. Anyway, I loved your review and agreed with all your points if you couldn't tell lol. Keep them coming!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'm so glad you're back. You're the *only* game reviewer I truly enjoy.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"you're alive! hope your back is good man, we missed u and joseph anderson"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Well heck. I'm gonna buy both because my mind won't allow me not to. Dreary, melancholic Slav-Jank is always comfy for me. Great video Mandalore!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Good to see you again, hope that back is feeling better"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Glad you're feeling a bit better mate. Hope you get back in prime condition soon.
Also, I pre-ordered the game on Steam, but I didn't know it wasn't doing well in sales. I went and bought it again on gog. I want these guys to do well and make another entry in 2. There are only a select few devs I'd do this for, and this is one of them.
Keep up the good work!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,this makes me feel ashamed for being a casual baby who doesn't like to try hard at games that try to make me earn my experiences

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I hope this review means more sales, which means I can finally play the Bachelor."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,can't wait till your next video and hope you stay healthy

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The game is worth enough on the voice acting alone. Russian game with good voice acting is a rare gem no matter what.

Great review btw"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,OH SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Amazing, thank you so much for publishing this review

And thank you for the little shout-out too!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Oh no, here,  jojo reference?  Wryyyyyyyy"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Pathologic 2 for me is the prime example of what games that strife to be art should be.
Be creative, have an artisti  vision that only a video game could manifest into the image that was imagined, yet most of all remembers that it is still a game. And games are ment to be played.

No hate on the people that really, really like Walking Simulators yet alone make them, but those sorts of games could easily have been a movie half the time and the other times are more popular on YouTube than their sales indicate. If you want to make art in form of a video game and want to push the media as such art in the eyes of everyone, don't compromise on the essential parts. Let the game be a game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"YEEEES HE'S BACK. Great review I hope you are feeling okay and recovering at a steady pace.

I have to say after watching your great review of the first pathologic, it put me off looking into the second. However,  I think this sequel or remake to the game pretty much irons out the issues I had with it. I'm definitely going to check this out. Nice one."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I hope this game gets more sales I would love to see the other characters in the new environment. And you are right this version is so well done even just watching a lets play go through it once was not satisfying. It got to the end and people died. They made some bad choices and I was right there with the lets player. I was so glad they did a 2nd run things where better but not perfect. That 2nd run felt more like a true ending even if it ended different having both run felt like it had to happen. I also am in the camp that a game like this dose not need top tier combat since the person your playing is not a combat specialist. Best trick in this game is almost broken lock picks. If they break on a stab it is a kill.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,damn i actually miss the old weirdo creepy triphop from the og game
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This game sounds a lot like it has the same kind of weirdness that makes Sunless Sea great.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,That intro proves mandalore and seth are the same person
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Yes.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I do appreciate the mind map, and there's already something similar in the form of Outer Wilds' ship log. You'd probably enjoy that game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Oh my god that mind map feature is fucking brilliant!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Please play paraworld
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Hahaha “I uh my head is someone shilling Raid shadow legends near me” YouTube sure is I got an ad for it before I could watch this!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Man, fuck this shit, I'm going to bed."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,You had me at the JoJo meme.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Good shit, got a copy!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I thought GoG only gives you a refund if the game does not work with your PC.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I would really like to see a review of the Void by these developers. It's so weird and magical.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Just knowing your sorta well makes me glad.
Hope you get even better"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I'm still interested in checking out the original just for the hell of it (though of course I'm aware I will need to put up with some major tedium), but already this game sounds like it's much more player friendly without taking away too much of the original's charm. The way you describe the game as a sorta remake and sorta sequel I guess the best comparison would be something like Evil Dead 2 (even down to removing select characters from the original for the sake of a slightly more streamlined narrative)."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I feel like I probably wouldn't actually like playing this game, but you make the game sound so fascinating I want to buy the game just to reward the devs for making something different and intriguing."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"11:42 Для полного счастья там должно быть 
Пацаны! Я маслину поймал!(c)"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Honestly... I want this game now.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""In a lot of [RPGs] playing good means you get less stuff..."" Even that isn't true with most RPGs. Majority of RPGs makes playing the good guy gives you same if not better stuff than playing the bad guy. I'm sure numerically there are some that grant you better rewards playing the bad guy, but the difference are so minor, that unless you're roleplaying for the fun of it, it doesn't affect you from at all."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Is the game already available for PlayStation 4? I tried searching at the store, tried looking in their website... And even though some news say the game was released for ps4 in May I can't get it anywhere but steam. What happened? Maybe it's because I'm ok Brazil...?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This honestly looks really good. But I'll have to add it to my wishlist rather than purchase it outright, since I have too many games I haven't gotten through yet. Once I reduce the backlog a bit I'm buying it -- if for no better reason than to support some talented people."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,YESHHH I WAITED FOR THIS VIDOE
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"ah pathologic 2, a beautiful game with great atmosphere, challenge, and a bleak crushing story.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I saw that LOWRY at 1:25
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It's a sequel and a remake and it makes references to the original that you don't need to see? So it's Evil Dead 2.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,the way you explain the reviews for this game sounds like how people are talking about remnant from the ashes
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I heard that neverhood soundtrack. You thought we wouldn't notice, but I did."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I feel like you didn't give the reviews surrounding this game a fair shake. For some examples:

 ScreenRant (https://screenrant.com/pathologic-2-review/ ) said the survival was the one of the best parts of the game, but the combat sucked so they gave it a 3/5 (which screenwrite specifies is a ""Good"" score to them). Ofc this shows up as a 60/100 on metacritic which could give the false impression they thought it was just meh. I bring this up as an example of why the game could get mediocre reviews that are unrelated to the survival.


PC gamer (https://www.pcgamer.com/pathologic-2-review/ ) says the survival mechanics are mostly annoying, but also criticizes the aesthetic of the game, citing the models looking rigid and lacking facial expression and calls the interiors repetitive. they gave it a 66/100.


Rock Paper Shotgun (https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/05/23/pathologic-2-review/ ) does mostly focus on the survival, but it also criticizes the combat, and the fact you get punished after you die. And again, most of the critique isn't that it is hard, but that constantly focusing on stamina and hunger bars means you don't focus on any of the good things. the review doesn't give a number but (as you know considering you showed a screen cap of this one in the video) it was highly critical. (btw that same author praised subnautica a lot in his review of the game, so he definitely doesn't think survival is bad so much as he thinks this game did survival badly.)


The point of this whole thing is to try to say that, yes people did dislike the survival, however they didn't dislike the survival because it meant the game wasn't a walking simulator, they disliked the survival because they thought the survival mechanics were bad. And to say that reviews surrounding this game aren't mediocre JUST because of the survival, but because a lot of people saw other problems too."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,No mention of the horrendous performance even after all this time from its release? Or the artificial difficulty steming from serious balance issues (on the so-called intented diffculty)? Come on...
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I was just re-watching the first one. Scary timing.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Why do you torture yourself so....

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Buying it because it looks playable now and to spite people who want more walking simulators.  Thanks Mandalore!

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Your video on Pathologic is what makes me super interested in the second game since you basically said it's a remake that fixes most of the flaws.

Seems like a great game, especially when you focus on the decisionmaking process and consequences - from your description it seems like some best RPGs out there could learn some things from Pathologic 2 devs."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I loved your first video on Pathologic and hearing that this is both a sequel and a remake is amazing. I'll purchase it tomorrow :)
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The people who complain about games being too hard need to realize what a challenge is and the satisfaction in overcoming that challenge.  These people decided to put you into the same situation as the people in the game are, if you complain that its too hard then you are missing that exact point, so many things aren't easy. I love games that challenge me but give me the options and opportunities to overcome that challenge, it treats you as an adult who can make decisions based on the current circumstances, not as an infant who cannot comprehend the concept of giving up one thing to gain the other. So many games these days hold your hand and treat you like a toddler through the entire game its sickening and downright insulting. 

Embrace the challenge and try to overcome it, just like with everything else, you won't be able to play a musical instrument at a snap of a finger, you will have to put in the time and effort and learn it to become good at it, then once you can play songs you weren't able to before you will gain immense satisfaction from that, you can't build a house in a day but once its done and finished you can be proud of the work you done and thats the beauty of the video games as entertainment platform, it gives you extremely convinient and easy way to access massively different and unique experiences in a format that can still be challenging and rewarding in the process of consuming it. The entire genre is based upon overcoming obstacles and beating challenges, from pong where the obstacle is the opponent to the games we have today such as city builders where you are challenged to make a working economy and so on, to shooters which test your reaction time and ability to adapt to rapidly changing situations, to grand strategy games where you are challenged to manage an empire with its own military and surpass competing nations in the race to complete domination, This crowd of ""games should be easy to consume by everyone"" do not understand what video games are built upon and that is Challenge, the game Challenges you to beat it, there are easier games and harder ones, no one can beat all of them, some people prefer easy games, others prefer complex games with many layers of difficulty because they enjoy the challenge and the satisfaction in overcoming it.
Even in a game of tag, you have to compete with other kids, UNO the same thing, basketball, the same thing, chess the same and so on and on. Games have been since the dawn of time challenges."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,thinking lord mandalore is a jojo-man just reinforced for me that he is a man of best taste. keep going my man. :D
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Wait wtf there's a pathologic 2! Shit yeah I want it.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The irony of a lot of the ""games are fine art"" crowd is that they don't actually seem to like games. They like virtual art exhibitions and shirk anything that requires a modicum of mental effort or dexterous skill, and thus often fail to see the artistic potential and value in actual games."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,eyyy cyka!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,SulMatul gang! lol
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,All hail for the return of our great dank Lord!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I was waiting for this. After all the one about the earlier iteration was excellent.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The visuals are giving me a Twin Peaks vibe. Looks so damn good.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Walking sims really fucked the gaming industry in terms of ""reviewers"" not wanting to actually play video games. Mandalore, you and a few others are amazing as you actually care. Thanks."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Neat.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,JJBA and gachi? Thank you sir!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I'm glad you called out the shallowness of some reviews. I think the highest-quality analysis is coming from YouTubers like you and Caldwell-Gervais. You have very different styles, but you both see what a game is attempting as a work of art and judge it based on that rubric, while acknowledging that you have your own biases and preferences, something I rarely see other reviewers do unfortunately."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Glad you got another video up.  Welcome back
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,FAST RAT MAGIC
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Im so fuckin excited for this video, too bad Im even more excited to play it myself and Id prefer to go in blind, Ill check back when Im done playing it!"

- Yes.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,NUT
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Yay! You reviewed pathologic 2, can you review overlord 2 next?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game better get the praise, money and love it deserves.
In a sea of garbage made to fulfill investors and satisfy dead lines more than inspire and create this is like watching the creation of something truly and utterly interesting, unique and great but then it dies because people are don't know any better due to a decade or two of garbage."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I T S  Q U I E T
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"YEEEEEEESSS
That was fast actually. And I havent even watched the video, but here is a like

After watching it fully:
I'm not dissapointed with the review. It's like waiting for a movie where you feel that it's gonna be very good, and it delivers. And somehow I like the second game better, the whole atmosphere is different, not as dead and more scary. And the graphics........man the grahics are beautiful. These slavic people can really deliver if they have the brain and money for it"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Oh, such a great ""Ей сука!"" - Mandalore you are like a big slavic boy now,  this gives me happy tears!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,This game looks amazing but I do miss the tribal trip hop soundtrack
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Ah, yes-yes, the disease-pleague will murder-kill the man-things.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Thanks sseth
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Great review, I like your style. Maybe I'll pick up Pathologic 2 - I played the first one ages ago and never could figure out what I was meant to do, but loved the atmosphere and general setting and premise of the game. You made the second one sound very interesting :)


Also ... MORROWIND! Please :)"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Aight, I might finna pick this up."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE!?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I honestly cant remember the last time i was so invested in a game. It forces you to actually think about your actions and find solutions to an overwhelming amount of obstacles.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Wait... There's a 2nd? The 1st looked good but the gameplay was too anus for me. Holy crap, please... If this one has decent gameplay I'll get it. PLEEEASE.
23:50 ... People insult this game... Because it's NOT a walking sim...? WHO LIKES WALKING SIMS? Those SUCK... I wanna buy this to spite anyone who says that now... Also cuz it sounds fun."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Just think for a moment. You could have been reviewing HOMM5.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I finished only moments into the video.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I always wanted to like the first game because of its atmosphere and writing but I couldn't stand actually playing it. This one looks a lot better
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Looks like Sseth is on his meds again.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Stroheim is coming in hot after that intro dawg.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"You know, I wasn't planning on getting this game. Your Pathologic review had made it pretty clear it wasn't for me.


But this looks very playable. I think I'll pick it up."

the best reviews out there I must say.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"We as a community have to try and support creators when they step outside of the mainstream, when they make bold descisions that might cost them mass appeal.
Stop buying AAA games, put the money into the hands of those who deserve it instead.  Make these weird experiments economically viable, or suffer walking simulators and formulaic games forever."

Seeing what 2 is like, I would say 1 was a better piece of art while 2 was a better game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,You know it’s gonna be good when Mandalore pulls out the Jojo references.

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I enjoy your eclectic choice of material to review. I suspect you would be a great dinner guest. Do you read books too?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Aww yiss, been waiting for a new one. It's raining outside, I have a blanket and some coffee. Fuck I'm snug right now. Ty Mandy bby"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Damn those Russians...they usually make such shit games....and then they make a game like this....and i'm floored, and wondering, if I missed something else this good....."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Good to have you back man. I've no lie been waiting for this review since this game was announced and good to hear it's much better over the first one. Will probably give it a look eventually (hopefully in time to actually financially help the game, but I'm in a financial pickle myself). Won't lie, was a bit worried at first with the video. Could almost hear the surgery/lack of energy in parts, but by the end you were your old self. Not saying those parts were bad. It was still a little worrying to hear. Still a great video man."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Pathologic 1 intimidated me with it's more exhausting mechanics, but I might try 2, because of this review"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"im so happy to hear its still pathologic and some of the jank we love was lost but the games actually,like, recommendable now!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I know you said you don't think you'll do Morrowind, but PLEASE DO MORROWIND"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Is that a fist of the North Star reference
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Incredible respect to the developers staying true to their vision while improving and expanding on the original.That sort of thing almost never happens for too many reasons to really list
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,It's quiet.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Very happy to see this video turn out so well.
Wishing you faster and better recovery Mandy, thanks again for introducing me to one of my favorite games"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Been looking forward to this, awesome video. Pathologic 2 was probably in my top 5 favorite games of all time, so I hope it gets enough attention to get The Bachelor at least, hopefully the Changeling too"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I do feel kinda worried about Pathologic's future. With game failing at sales and some people leaving IPL, I'm afraid we might not see Bachelor's and Changeling's (i still don't get why she was translated like that) campaigns at all. 
Quite a pity, considering the first part being my nearly first computer game ever and an experience influential enough to make me take a gamedesigner career. :c"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Hey hey Mandalore, people here."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"So many game journalists have their heads up their ass about what is and is not ""art"" in a game.
""Art"" games are the walking simulators, as you've put it. 
So, when a game takes a break from telling a ""pure"" story via nothing but a first-person camera, diary entries, and dialogue, it's seen as ""gamey"". Plenty of games have both excellent uses of mechanical elements, while also having great narratives. These people so often only see half of the picture. It has become increasingly clear to me over the years that many game journalists are writers first and enthusiasts second. Why have a game where you're a survivor of a plague outbreak when you could just be an immortal tourist? It seems so boring to consider games this way. This is why many YouTubers such as yourself, Mandalore, are filling a much-desired niche. I would personally like to thank you for telling me that this game existed, and offering it's finest qualities for me to see. Because of this, I am going to purchase it, support the devs, and form my own opinion. Something that I wouldn't have done if I was just reading reviews on mainstream websites."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Kingdom under fire

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Glad to have your videos back Mandalore, hope you're doing better. Even though I don't like it when reviews mention other reviewers, I feel like in this case it was perfectly justified since the point you raised was perfectly valid, I feel like a lot of reviewers tend to discard the intentions of the developers in favor of their own vision of what their ideal game should be. That last bit really sold just how important survival mechanics can be when they're placed in games that aren't survival for the sake of survival if that makes sense."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I love that dig you gave to the crowd who fawn over walking simulators as art but didn't like Pathologic 2 just because of its survival mechanics.

That was beautiful.

Just because they're not trendy anymore, doesn't mean they weren't put into the game for a reason."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The other two characters are coming out as free DLC because they realised the game would be delayed for signifficantly longer if they put all 3 out at once.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The ""games are art"" walking simulator types don't actually want to play games.  They want to read visual novels or watch movies."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"""Pathologic 2 starts to feel less like an interesting failure and more like a budget Skyrim.""
Good lord, these people deserve the Bright Noah treatment."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I just felt the hunger/thirst was excessive and intrusive at default. You raised a point about how it forced you to choose between yourself or others, but I'd disagree - the base settings remove that choice. You don't have the choice to make a choice about whether or not you're willing to sacrifice your resources, because you're constantly at the level where you take for yourself or you die, which distances you from the ability to make that choice of sacrifice. 
If you're going to make the sacrifice, you need to be able to at least convince yourself that you can balance that somehow, or that a hard sacrifice is going to have a beneficial consequence. Pathalogic 2's main problem with regards to how the survival mechanics tie into the characters, is that the choice is, ultimately, whether you live or die. The default settings leave no space for another option. As your main task is to survive, you don't have a choice to put other people before yourself as they are not the axis on which the narrative revolves and so the option of a noble sacrifice is rendered meaningless. It's less a problem of it not being a walking simulator, and more a problem that the game mechanic was overbearing to the extent that it got in the way of the narrative tone it was attempting to reinforce."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Glad to have you back Papa Mandy! Hope your back is doing better!

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"This game is a PERFECT example of how useless traditional journalists are.
Pathologic 2 is one of the most pure examples of just how good of an artform video games can be especially when the artists making them EMBRACE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MAKING A GAME, but instead of realizing this and praising the fact that in Pathologic 2 more than pretty much any other game YOU the player are an actor in an interactive play, these useless journos whine that they aren't having a slightly interactive book/movie experience like all the trash walking sims out there."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"The Void (Turgor) review next, logically?"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I didn't watch it yet, but just wanted to write: thank you for the new review. All your videos are very good!"

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,is that the neverhood music i hear? :D
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"3:49 Stormvermin dancing is not something I thought I'd see, is this in the lore? Given this is the place I'd expect Skaven to be, can't get to Mordheim? Just go here, for all we know this town is filled with Warpstone, that'll get every Ratman from Skavenblight to Lustria to come here, I mean, maybe a Plague Monk spilled all his diseases and collected up all of them except one, the Sand Plague, this could be the prequel to a Eastern European Game, 'Black, well, usually Brown but rarely you can get Grey or White and if you previously lived near Volcanoes then Red... Multi-Coloured Death' I'd buy it, hey, speaking of dying cities infested by Ratmen and various other unsavoury types, infact I've even mentioned it, about Eleven lines ago, are you gonna do Mordheim City of the Damned? You can play as Ratmen who sound like Pirates"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,What’s your address so I can personally email you likes?
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Thanks for the video Mandalore. I'm really glad to hear you're recovering and well enough to finish up the video. Hopefully it isn't pushing yourself too hard to do so, but I think the fans are glad to hear you're back at it :)"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Great to see you back, hope you are feeling better."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"While I certainly can respect the aims of this game, I didn't think it fulfills them very well. Integrating the theme of sacrifice with the gameplay is all well and good, but there is far more to making a good difficult game than just making it difficult in any way you can manage. And for me, neither struggling with Artemy's completely absurd insatiable hunger nor discovering I could more or less easily manage it by trading food for random garbage with children was interesting or immersive, nor did it strengthen the game's themes. I'm not gonna try to defend all negative reviews, but I think the general response this game got is fully justified. Because while I'm inclined to agree with all of the things you're praising, as someone who has played and enjoyed various difficult games before, I'm still not convinced that this is a well-designed game. Of course, what constitutes ""interesting challenge"" is subjective at the end of the day, and you, Mandalore, clearly seem to see it more favorably but... yeah, I need some strong focused arguments regarding the specifics of the design of this game to change my mind."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Good to see you were capable of making this, but you should focus on your well being. You shouldn't have to suffer severe back pain for your work."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,The whole idea that hard games are bad because (current year moronic) people can't just sit back and enjoy them like a movie is infuriating.  Fuck game journalism.
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Good video I enjoyed it and happy to see a new video from you :)

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Pathologic 2 is like a video game adaptation of Pathologic
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I blame TinyBuild. They're not a good publisher. They release a lot of undercooked games, some of which had horrible PR. They have no standard for quality and hence they aren't a great company to associate your product with. Pathologic 2 is actually the first high-profile game they published when you think about it, and I don't think they handled it well. There wasn't much done in terms of advertising or anything."

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,You know it's an Eastern European video game when you can trade scissors to children for morphine...
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,I'm so happy you've finally made this been waiting since i started playing the game months ago!
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I think why most people can't stand games like this is because the tedious nature of gameplay overrides everything else and numbs them to ""those moments"" that make the game stand out to other people. While some may be able to say ""Yes, searching for X is tedious, but it led to Y encounter which was so memorable,"" most people would would say ""I was so bored and frustrated and angry at this game that my mind glazed over and it's all a blur and I can't even remember Y moment happening."" 


10 years ago, I was pretty comfortably in the former camp, but today, I'm in that latter. Games like this are more interesting to hear people talk about than to play for me."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,Wow the game setting is some sort of crazy noisy bizarre town.

-encourages curiosity and full on 'I wonder how X is doing, I'll visit them since it's on the way' as that immersion into the local ecosystem takes root and you start networking and building relationships with the locals
-full interaction in general

Please people, if you buy one game this month BUY THIS ONE. Don't wait for a sale or wait for the nearest sale, but just do it!"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"yeah, that's professional game journalists for you. Scratching on the surface, doesn't understand the point of the mechanics, writing hitpieces to generate clicks.


Just imagine if Planescape: Torment comes out today : ""hurr durr if I want to read that much I read a book. Where's the voice actor?!!!?!?!?!?!?! and muh easy mode""


Would be neat if more people would try to have a open mindset and let the game do his thing, than trying to adjust everything to their preferences and playstyle.


Hell just, because Starcraft 2 is too fast for me (hey, don't judge, I'm not getting younger), I'm not saying ""yeah man, this game would be so much better if it would be slower"" (yes it has a speed setting), I'm still able to see its merit and why playing on this speed is wortwhile, even if it is not for me ..X-x

Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,FINALLY
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"Liked before watching cause I already know it's gonna be good.

Edit: One thing I'd like to mention about GOG's refund policy is that they'll only refund it if you can't run the game for some reason AFTER support tries helping you through fixing it, and not because you didn't like the game.

But I reckon that wouldn't be a huge issue though because if you're on GOG, you're already likely the type of person who would like this game."
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"I just finished watching your review of the first Pathologic. Got intrigued after I saw it on sale on Gog for less then 2$. And now you published the review for the 2nd one 22 mins ago

yup"
Pathologic 2,E7uKUgire7Y,"HOLY SHIT

Disco Elysium,YV2lp6p_gXw,"I don't know this game, but I just asked chatgpt to list the best rated 10 games of all times and this came up 7th.

From the outside I must say, it looks like a generic mobile text game, and the next mission it will make me play those candy crush type games lol.

I understand I'm surely wrong and it must be really good to have that rating, I'm just saying that's how it looks like before playing it."
Disco Elysium,YV2lp6p_gXw,This game is such a euro analog vibe. It's just from another place in the universe that's close but so far away

Disco Elysium,YV2lp6p_gXw,"The true question is; is each voice in our head going to be VA'd as well, and each with a different tone? Or is it just the physical characters that are getting VA'd? Either way, excited to pick this one up again"

Disco Elysium,YV2lp6p_gXw,Yeah I’ll be buying this on PS5 for sure. I somehow missed out on the PC version even after hearing all those great things but I’m in for the PS5 version. Story seems incredible and the world looks incredibly well-made.

Disco Elysium,YV2lp6p_gXw,.
Disco Elysium,YV2lp6p_gXw,“Ground breaking role playing game”
Disco Elysium,YV2lp6p_gXw,ok
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"I first played this completely blind without reading anything about it, in a language I didn’t fully understand and at 2 am and it was a trip."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,This isn't a game.  Its an interactive book
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Is this even a game
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Thanks xbox gamepass
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,This is the most boring game I've ever played
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,The aesthetic is reminiscent of Flashback and 'Out of This World'.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,;
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,so it's sound novel ?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,If Andrei Tarkovsky would be a game developer
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,What the frick kinda game is this...pause on 5:11 and read that little section there...um ok
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"wait, those the same guys that made outer wilds? I'm interested!"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"You're here cause of gamepass, aren't you?"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Some pieces of media are special for hard to explain reasons.   KRZ is special, kinda the in the same way firefly is special."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Shockingly decent review by ign
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,this looks great.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,what were the other games?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Worst game I've played since...... I don't know, can't think of something worse right now..."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"It's on sale on xbox right now, just watched the review, gonna buy it, I love these kind of games."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Ooohh, replaces puzzles with “reams of dialogue”, sounds fuuunnnn."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,if you appreciate games as art then you need to get this game. It's has by far the best writing in any game i have ever played. it's also wildly creative in the things you do to progress the story. the music is also GREAT
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Disco Elysium blew my mind when I played it earlier in the year, so maybe this one's worth checking out?"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"This game won't be for everyone but if you're into ambient, surreal, abstract stuff in the vein of Twin Peaks you should definitely give KRZ a shot. I absolutely loved it. And I have to agree with the reviewer- the scene with the song rates up there with one of the most unforgettable moments I've had in a game."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,DAVIDE STRAMBINO Conservo il silenzio interiore attraverso il rumore
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Will i enjoy and  understand this game even if i never played a prior one?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"If this is supposed to be Kentucky, people randomly breaking into their life story in the gas station is just a point toward realism.

-a Kentuckian"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,i feel like this would make an incredible book if it were ever novelized
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Some Twin Peaks fans here ?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"""Stunning to look"" at...and ""taking screenshots"" are not lines I would use for this review... -_-"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Ben Babbit, the composer is so underappreciated.
He also did the soundtrack to an indie film titled ""Paris Window"" and my gosh it hits hard."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,As a Kentuckian I can say this is exactly what Kentucky is like
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Now 25% off on Nintendo eshop 😉
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,What does this game have to do with Kentucky?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"I literally never heard of this game. Hmm...oh well, no I have. o>O"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Not a game. It has no game elements
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Yay....... Reading.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Soo, ummmm, what's this game about ???"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Am I the only one who doesn't get why people like this game? Seems pretty boring.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,0:49 so its a point click not an adventure but still somehow a game?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,That game cover tho
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"So Boring, and pretentious. Got it."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"this game makes me think of tipp-ex, dirty dirty tipp-ex."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,This is literally the polar opposite of Zero Punctuation's review.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"I remember playing it in a windowless room on a laptop, might get the full thing on PS4. Love it"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"It’s weird seeing so many critics and gamers rank this game among the best yet IGN just gives it an 8 and says “yeah, it’s pretty cool”. It’s their opinion and I’m certainly not saying they can’t have it, it’s just a shame they can make or break how well a game does due to their appeal to casual gamers and everyone who hasn’t heard of KRZ will just say “Oh, so it’s just another indie game that isn’t that special.”"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,The funny thing is it takes place in my state kentucky like about time my state actually had a game
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,The trailer serves the game ZERO justice it's a confusing mess from start to finish that paints no image of what's actually going on.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Act V is an abject failure and a waste of three years.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"what do you mean by ""stuttering?"""
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Can't wait for this to be in GDQ
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,This game is boring and pretentious
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"If you're into writing, this is a must. Best written game alongside Disco Elysium. Feels like a game written by Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Jorge Luis Borges."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Is this game longer than Oxenfree?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Jeez, I bought the season pass for this on Steam in what it is clearly now the best part of a decade ago and always thought to return to it over the last couple of years presuming it must surely be complete by then. They've only just finished it?! Oh well, yet another double-dip Steam/Switch purchase coming up then."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Any other games like KRZ, Oxenfree, Night in the Woods?"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"this game is a 10/10, one of the most inspiring and most inspired games I've ever played. IGN is too dumb to review something like this."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,this game is 10 easily
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Okay, time to see if this was actually building to something that made at least some sort of sense, or if it was just lynchian “weird-for-the-sake-of-weird” nonsense."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Fantastic review
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,isnt this game 7 years old?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,I think I wanna play this. 🤔
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Is this like Oxenfree?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,This game is so fuckin expensive
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,I remember seeing the developer win an award YEARS AGO and then it pops up on switch? This game is in Acts?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"Another one of those games that will touch my heart and stuff ?
Nah, I'd prefer mindless bloodshed. DOOM can't come sooner."
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"1:30 you are ""sure"" there is a ""whole nove's worth"" of text hidden behind the choices you did not take?
As a reviewer - you did not go out of you way to check if your choices actually matter? - Or if it's just an illusion of choice, like in so many other games?!"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,This game looks boring.
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,The only game I know of that has my home state in the title lol
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,I'm REALLY looking forward to playing this game for the first time!
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Why can't buy this on PS4?!?
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3kkcgIdbuI&t=1283s
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,Wow....I was just 'bout to search up if the 5th Act for this game came out or not and here is the review already. Nice!!!!!
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,It's a 10 at the least
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,I was never really insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,"FINALLY, after so many years"
Kentucky Route Zero (PC EdiMon),1LBUBRI21Nc,kobe ded
